2	927	1	[Verse 1]
2	928	2	Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
2	929	3	Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
2	930	4	Everybody here wanted something more
2	931	5	Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
2	932	6	And it said
2	933	7	
2	934	8	[Chorus]
2	935	9	Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
2	936	10	Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
2	937	11	Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
2	938	12	Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
2	939	13	It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
2	940	14	The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
2	941	15	Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
2	942	16	Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
2	943	17	[Verse 2]
2	944	18	When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
2	945	19	Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
2	946	20	Everybody here was someone else before
2	947	21	And you can want who you want
2	948	22	Boys and boys and girls and girls
2	949	23	
2	950	24	[Chorus]
2	951	25	Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
2	952	26	Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
2	953	27	Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
2	954	28	Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
2	955	29	It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
2	956	30	The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me
2	957	31	Welcome to New York (New York), it's been waiting for you
2	958	32	Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
2	959	33	
2	960	34	[Bridge]
2	961	35	Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
2	962	36	Like any real love, it's ever-changing
2	963	37	Like any true love, it drives you crazy
2	964	38	But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything
2	965	39	
2	966	40	[Chorus]
2	967	41	Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
2	968	42	Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
2	969	43	Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
2	970	44	Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
2	971	45	It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat
2	972	46	The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
2	973	47	Welcome to New York (New soundtrack)
2	974	48	It's been waiting for you
2	975	49	Welcome to New York
2	976	50	The lights are so bright but they never blind me
2	977	51	Welcome to New York
2	978	52	So bright, they never blind me
2	979	53	Welcome to New York
2	980	54	Welcome to New York
3	240	1	[Verse 1]
3	241	2	Nice to meet you, where you been?
3	242	3	I could show you incredible things
3	243	4	Magic, madness, heaven, sin
3	244	5	Saw you there and I thought
3	245	6	"Oh, my God, look at that face
3	246	7	You look like my next mistake
3	247	8	Love's a game, wanna play?" Ayy
3	248	9	New money, suit and tie
3	249	10	I can read you like a magazine
3	250	11	Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
3	251	12	And I know you heard about me
3	252	13	So, hey, let's be friends
3	253	14	I'm dying to see how this one ends
3	254	15	Grab your passport and my hand
3	255	16	I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
3	256	17	[Chorus]
3	257	18	So, it's gonna be forever
3	258	19	Or it's gonna go down in flames?
3	259	20	You can tell me when it's over, mm
3	260	21	If the high was worth the pain
3	261	22	Got a long list of ex-lovers
3	262	23	They'll tell you I'm insane
3	263	24	'Cause you know I love the players
3	264	25	And you love the game
3	265	26	'Cause we're young and we're reckless
3	266	27	We'll take this way too far
3	267	28	It'll leave you breathless, mm
3	268	29	Or with a nasty scar
3	269	30	Got a long list of ex-lovers
3	270	31	They'll tell you I'm insane
3	271	32	But I've got a blank space, baby
3	272	33	And I'll write your name
3	273	34	
3	274	35	[Verse 2]
3	275	36	Cherry lips, crystal skies
3	276	37	I could show you incredible things
3	277	38	Stolen kisses, pretty lies
3	278	39	You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
3	279	40	Find out what you want
3	280	41	Be that girl for a month
3	281	42	Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
3	282	43	Screaming, crying, perfect storms
3	283	44	I can make all the tables turn
3	284	45	Rose garden filled with thorns
3	285	46	Keep you second guessing, like
3	286	47	"Oh, my God, who is she?"
3	287	48	I get drunk on jealousy
3	288	49	But you'll come back each time you leave
3	289	50	'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
3	290	51	[Chorus]
3	291	52	So, it's gonna be forever
3	292	53	Or it's gonna go down in flames?
3	293	54	You can tell me when it's over, mm
3	294	55	If the high was worth the pain
3	295	56	Got a long list of ex-lovers
3	296	57	They'll tell you I'm insane
3	297	58	'Cause you know I love the players
3	298	59	And you love the game
3	299	60	'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh)
3	300	61	We'll take this way too far
3	301	62	It'll leave you breathless (Oh-oh), mm
3	302	63	Or with a nasty scar
3	303	64	Got a long list of ex-lovers
3	304	65	They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
3	305	66	But I've got a blank space, baby
3	306	67	And I'll write your name
3	307	68	
3	308	69	[Bridge]
3	309	70	Boys only want love if it's torture
3	310	71	Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
3	311	72	Boys only want love if it's torture
3	312	73	Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
3	313	74	
3	314	75	[Chorus]
3	315	76	So, it's gonna be forever

3	326	87	Or with a nasty scar (With a nasty scar)
3	327	88	Got a long list of ex-lovers

3	329	90	But I've got a blank space, baby
3	330	91	And I'll write your name
4	802	1	[Verse 1]
4	803	2	Midnight
4	804	3	You come and pick me up, no headlights
4	805	4	A long drive
4	806	5	Could end in burning flames or paradise
4	807	6	Fade into view, oh
4	808	7	It's been a while since I have even heard from you
4	809	8	(Heard from you)
4	810	9	
4	811	10	[Pre-Chorus]
4	812	11	And I should just tell you to leave
4	813	12	'Cause I know exactly where it leads
4	814	13	But I watch us go 'round and 'round each time
4	815	14	[Chorus]
4	816	15	You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
4	817	16	And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
4	818	17	And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
4	819	18	'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
4	820	19	You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
4	821	20	And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
4	822	21	And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
4	823	22	'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
4	824	23	
4	825	24	[Verse 2]

4	827	26	He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mmm
4	828	27	Takes me home
4	829	28	The lights are off, he's taking off his coat, mmm, yeah
4	830	29	I say, "I heard, oh
4	831	30	That you've been out and about with some other girl"
4	832	31	Some other girl
4	833	32	
4	834	33	[Pre-Chorus]
4	835	34	He says, "What you heard is true
4	836	35	But I can't stop thinking 'bout you and I"
4	837	36	I said, "I've been there too a few times"
4	838	37	
4	839	38	[Chorus]

5	629	1	[Verse 1]
5	630	2	Looking at it now
5	631	3	It all seems so simple
5	632	4	We were lying on your couch
5	633	5	I remember
5	634	6	You took a Polaroid of us
5	635	7	Then discovered (Then discovered)
5	636	8	The rest of the world was black and white
5	637	9	But we were in screaming color
5	638	10	And I remember thinking
5	639	11	[Chorus]
5	640	12	Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
5	641	13	Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?

5	648	20	(Are we out of the woods?)
5	649	21	[Verse 2]
5	650	22	Looking at it now
5	651	23	Last December (Last December)
5	652	24	We were built to fall apart
5	653	25	Then fall back together (Back together)
5	654	26	Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
5	655	27	The night we couldn't quite forget
5	656	28	When we decided, we decided
5	657	29	To move the furniture so we could dance
5	658	30	Baby, like we stood a chance
5	659	31	Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
5	660	32	And I remember thinking
5	661	33	
5	662	34	[Chorus]
5	663	35	Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
5	664	36	Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?

5	670	42	Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
5	671	43	(Are we out of the woods?)
5	672	44	[Bridge]
5	673	45	Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
5	674	46	Twenty stitches in the hospital room
5	675	47	When you started crying, baby, I did too
5	676	48	But when the sun came up, I was looking at you
5	677	49	Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
5	678	50	I walked out, I said, "I'm setting you free"
5	679	51	But the monsters turned out to be just trees
5	680	52	When the sun came up, you were looking at me
5	681	53	You were looking at me, ooh
5	682	54	You were looking at me
5	683	55	(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?)

11	479	78	That's how you got the girl
12	861	1	[Verse 1]
12	862	2	Clear blue water
12	863	3	High tide came and brought you in
12	864	4	And I could go on and on, on and on and I will
12	865	5	Skies grew darker
12	866	6	Currents swept you out again
12	867	7	And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone
12	868	8	
12	869	9	[Pre-Chorus]
12	870	10	In silent screams and wildest dreams
12	871	11	I never dreamed of this
12	872	12	[Chorus]
12	873	13	This love is good, this love is bad
12	874	14	This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
12	875	15	These hands had to let it go free, and
12	876	16	This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
12	877	17	Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
12	878	18	
12	879	19	[Verse 2]
12	880	20	Tossing, turning
12	881	21	Struggled through the night with someone new
12	882	22	Baby, I could go on and on, on and on
12	883	23	Lantern, burning
12	884	24	Flickered in my mind, only you
12	885	25	But you were still gone, gone, gone
12	886	26	
12	887	27	[Pre-Chorus]
12	888	28	Been losing grip on sinking ships
12	889	29	You showed up just in time
12	890	30	
12	891	31	[Chorus]
12	892	32	This love is good, this love is bad
12	893	33	This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
12	894	34	These hands had to let it go free, and
12	895	35	This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

12	897	37	This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh
12	898	38	These hands had to let it go free, and

12	905	45	
12	906	46	[Bridge]
12	907	47	Your kiss, my cheek, I watched you leave
12	908	48	Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees
12	909	49	When you're young, you just run
12	910	50	But you come back to what you need
12	911	51	
12	912	52	[Chorus]
12	913	53	This love is good, this love is bad
12	914	54	This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
12	915	55	These hands had to let it go free, and

13	485	6	
13	486	7	[Verse 1]
13	487	8	You stand with your hand on my waistline
13	488	9	It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
13	489	10	I can hear them whisper as we pass by
13	490	11	It's a bad sign, bad sign
13	491	12	Something happens when everybody finds out
13	492	13	See the vultures circling, dark clouds
13	493	14	Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
13	494	15	It could burn out
13	495	16	[Pre-Chorus]
13	496	17	'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
13	497	18	They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run
13	498	19	
13	499	20	[Chorus]
13	500	21	Baby, I know places we won't be found
13	501	22	And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
13	502	23	'Cause I, I know places we can hide
13	503	24	I know places, I know places
13	504	25	
13	505	26	[Verse 2]
13	506	27	Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
13	507	28	Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
13	508	29	Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
13	509	30	Not this time
13	510	31	
13	511	32	[Pre-Chorus]
13	512	33	Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
13	513	34	They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run
13	514	35	
13	515	36	[Chorus]
13	516	37	Baby, I know places we won't be found
13	517	38	And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
13	518	39	'Cause I, I know places we can hide
13	519	40	I know places
13	520	41	[Bridge]
13	521	42	They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run
13	522	43	Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love

13	524	45	[Chorus]
13	525	46	Baby, I know places we won't be found

13	527	48	'Cause I, I know places we can hide
13	528	49	I know places
13	529	50	
13	530	51	[Outro]
13	531	52	They take their shots, but we're bulletproof (I know places)
13	532	53	And you know for me, it's always you (I know places)
13	533	54	In the dead of night, your eyes so green (I know places)
13	534	55	And I know for you, it's always me (I know places)
13	535	56	I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I

14	332	2	The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
14	333	3	When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
14	334	4	It was months and months of back and forth (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
14	335	5	You're still all over me
14	336	6	Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
14	337	7	
14	338	8	[Pre-Chorus]
14	339	9	Hung my head as I lost the war
14	340	10	And the sky turned black like a perfect storm
14	341	11	[Chorus]
14	342	12	Rain came pouring down
14	343	13	When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
14	344	14	And by morning
14	345	15	Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
14	346	16	(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
14	347	17	
14	348	18	[Verse 2]
14	349	19	There was nothing left to do (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
14	350	20	When the butterflies turned to
14	351	21	Dust that covered my whole room
14	352	22	So I punched a hole in the roof (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
14	353	23	Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
14	354	24	
14	355	25	[Pre-Chorus]
14	356	26	The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
14	357	27	But no one heard a thing
14	358	28	
14	359	29	[Chorus]
14	360	30	Rain came pouring down

14	372	42	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
14	373	43	[Bridge]
14	374	44	Ten months sober, I must admit
14	375	45	Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
14	376	46	Ten months older, I won't give in
14	377	47	Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it
14	378	48	
14	379	49	[Breakdown]
14	380	50	The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

17	1290	44	Rose garden filled with thorns
17	1291	45	Keep you second guessin', like
17	1292	46	"Oh, my God, who is she?"
17	1293	47	I get drunk on jealousy

19	1841	27	And fall back together (Back together)
19	1842	28	Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
19	1843	29	The night we couldn't quite forget
19	1844	30	When we decided, we decided
19	1845	31	To move the furniture so we could dance
19	1846	32	Baby, like we stood a chance
19	1847	33	Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying

19	1862	48	Twenty stitches in the hospital room
19	1863	49	When you started crying, baby, I did too
19	1864	50	But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you
19	1865	51	Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
19	1866	52	I walked out, I said, "I'm settin' you free"

26	2294	64	
26	2295	65	[Post-Chorus]
26	2296	66	(This love, this love, oh, this love, this love) Oh-oh-oh
26	2297	67	(This love, this love, this love, this love) Oh-oh-oh
26	2298	68	(This love, this love, this love, this love)
26	2299	69	(This love, this love, this love, this love)
26	2300	70	This love came back to me, oh-oh-oh
27	1471	1	[Intro]
27	1472	2	I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
27	1473	3	I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
27	1474	4	I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I, I-I (I, I)
27	1475	5	
27	1476	6	[Verse 1]
27	1477	7	You stand with your hand on my waistline
27	1478	8	It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
27	1479	9	I can hear them whisper as we pass by
27	1480	10	It's a bad sign, bad sign
27	1481	11	Somethin' happens when everybody finds out
27	1482	12	See the vultures circlin', dark clouds
27	1483	13	Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
27	1484	14	It could burn out
27	1485	15	
27	1486	16	[Pre-Chorus]
27	1487	17	'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
27	1488	18	They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run
27	1489	19	
27	1490	20	[Chorus]
27	1491	21	Baby, I know places we won't be found
27	1492	22	And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
27	1493	23	'Cause I, I know places we can hide
27	1494	24	I know places, I know places
27	1495	25	
27	1496	26	[Verse 2]
27	1497	27	Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
27	1498	28	Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
27	1499	29	Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
27	1500	30	Not this time
27	1501	31	[Pre-Chorus]
27	1502	32	Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
27	1503	33	They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run
27	1504	34	
27	1505	35	[Chorus]
27	1506	36	Baby (Baby), I know places we won't be found
27	1507	37	And they'll (They'll) be (Be) chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
27	1508	38	'Cause I, I know places we can hide
27	1509	39	I know places
27	1510	40	
27	1511	41	[Bridge]
27	1512	42	They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run
27	1513	43	Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
27	1514	44	
27	1515	45	[Chorus]
27	1516	46	Baby (Baby), I know places we won't be found
27	1517	47	And they'll (They'll) be (Be) chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
27	1518	48	'Cause I, I know places we can hide
27	1519	49	I know places
27	1520	50	
27	1521	51	[Post-Chorus]
27	1522	52	(I) They take their shots, but we're bulletproof (I know places)
27	1523	53	(Hide) And you know, for me, it's always you (I know places)
27	1524	54	(I) In the dead of night, your eyes so green (I know places)
27	1525	55	(Hide) And I know, for you, it's always me (I know places)
27	1526	56	[Outro]
27	1527	57	I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
27	1528	58	I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I (I, I)
28	1337	1	[Verse 1]
28	1338	2	The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah
28	1339	3	When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
28	1340	4	It was months and months of back and forth, ah-ah, ah-ah
28	1341	5	You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
28	1342	6	
28	1343	7	[Pre-Chorus]
28	1344	8	Hung my head as I lost the war
28	1345	9	And the sky turned black like a perfect storm
28	1346	10	
28	1347	11	[Chorus]
28	1348	12	The rain came pouring down
28	1349	13	When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
28	1350	14	And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
28	1351	15	I think I am finally clean
28	1352	16	
28	1353	17	[Verse 2]
28	1354	18	There was nothin' left to do, ah-ah, ah-ah
28	1355	19	When the butterflies turnеd to dust that covered my whole room
28	1356	20	So I punchеd a hole in the roof, ah-ah, ah-ah
28	1357	21	Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
28	1358	22	
28	1359	23	[Pre-Chorus]
28	1360	24	The water filled my lungs
28	1361	25	I screamed so loud, but no one heard a thing
28	1362	26	[Chorus]
28	1363	27	The rain came pourin' down
28	1364	28	When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
28	1365	29	And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
28	1366	30	I think I am finally clean
28	1367	31	
28	1368	32	[Post-Chorus]
28	1369	33	I think I am finally clean
28	1370	34	Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
28	1371	35	Said I think I am finally clean
28	1372	36	Ah-ah-ah
28	1373	37	
28	1374	38	[Bridge]
28	1375	39	Ten months sober, I must admit
28	1376	40	Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
28	1377	41	Ten months older, I won't give in
28	1378	42	Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it
28	1379	43	
28	1380	44	[Break]
28	1381	45	The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah
28	1382	46	When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
28	1383	47	
28	1384	48	[Chorus]
28	1385	49	The rain came pourin' down
28	1386	50	When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
28	1387	51	And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
28	1388	52	I think I am finally clean
28	1389	53	The rain came pourin' down
28	1390	54	When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
28	1391	55	And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
28	1392	56	I think I am finally clean
28	1393	57	[Outro]
28	1394	58	Finally clean
28	1395	59	Think I'm finally clean
28	1396	60	Ah-ah-ah-ah
28	1397	61	Think I'm finally clean
29	2429	1	[Verse 1]
29	2430	2	Flashin' lights
29	2431	3	And we took a wrong turn
29	2432	4	And we fell down a rabbit hole
29	2433	5	You held on tight to me
29	2434	6	’Cause nothing's as it seems
29	2435	7	And spinning out of control
29	2436	8	
29	2437	9	[Pre-Chorus]
29	2438	10	Didn't they tell us, "Don’t rush into things"?
29	2439	11	Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
29	2440	12	Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
29	2441	13	Ooh, didn't it all seem new and excitin'?
29	2442	14	I felt your arms twistin' around me
29	2443	15	I should have slept with one eye open at night
29	2444	16	
29	2445	17	[Chorus]
29	2446	18	We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
29	2447	19	And we pretended it could last forever, eh
29	2448	20	We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
29	2449	21	And life was never worse, but nevеr better, eh, еh
29	2450	22	
29	2451	23	[Post-Chorus]
29	2452	24	In Wonderland
29	2453	25	In Wonderland
29	2454	26	In Wonderland
29	2455	27	In Wonderland
29	2456	28	[Verse 2]
29	2457	29	So, we went on our way
29	2458	30	Too in love to think straight
29	2459	31	All alone or so it seemed
29	2460	32	But there were strangers watchin'
29	2461	33	And whispers turned to talkin'
29	2462	34	And talking turned to screams, oh
29	2463	35	
29	2464	36	[Pre-Chorus]
29	2465	37	Didn’t they tell us, "Don’t rush into things"?
29	2466	38	Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
29	2467	39	Didn’t you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?
29	2468	40	Ooh, didn't it all seem new and excitin'?
29	2469	41	I felt your arms twistin' around me
29	2470	42	It’s all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind
29	2471	43	But darlin'
29	2472	44	
29	2473	45	[Chorus]
29	2474	46	We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
29	2475	47	And we pretended it could last forever, eh
29	2476	48	We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
29	2477	49	And life was never worse, but never better, eh, eh
29	2478	50	
29	2479	51	[Post-Chorus]
29	2480	52	In Wonderland, eh, eh
29	2481	53	In Wonderland
29	2482	54	In Wonderland, woah
29	2483	55	In Wonderland
29	2484	56	[Bridge]
29	2485	57	I reached for you, but you were gone
29	2486	58	I knew I had to go back home
29	2487	59	You searched the world for somethin' else
29	2488	60	To make you feel like what we had
29	2489	61	And in the end, in Wonderland, we both went mad
29	2490	62	Oh
29	2491	63	
29	2492	64	[Chorus]
29	2493	65	We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
29	2494	66	And we pretended it could last forever (Could last forever)
29	2495	67	We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (Got lost in it)
29	2496	68	And life was never worse, but never better (Never better)
29	2497	69	We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (In Wonderland)
29	2498	70	And we pretended it could last forever (In Wonderland)
29	2499	71	We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (In Wonderland)
29	2500	72	And life was never worse, but never better
29	2501	73	In Wonderland
30	2502	1	[Verse 1]
30	2503	2	One look, dark room, meant just for you
30	2504	3	Time moved too fast, you play it back
30	2505	4	Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
30	2506	5	No proof, not much, but you saw enough
30	2507	6	Small talk, he drives, coffee at midnight
30	2508	7	The light reflects the chain on your neck
30	2509	8	He says, "Look up" and your shoulders brush
30	2510	9	No proof, one touch, but you felt enough
30	2511	10	
30	2512	11	[Chorus]
30	2513	12	You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
30	2514	13	You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
30	2515	14	You can see it with the lights out (See it with the lights out), lights out (Lights out)
30	2516	15	You are in love, true love, you are in lovе
30	2517	16	
30	2518	17	[Verse 2]
30	2519	18	Morning, his place, burnt toast, Sunday
30	2520	19	You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
30	2521	20	And for once, you lеt go of your fears and your ghosts
30	2522	21	One step, not much, but it said enough
30	2523	22	You kiss on sidewalks, you fight, then you talk
30	2524	23	One night, he wakes, strange look on his face
30	2525	24	Pauses, then says, "You're my best friend"
30	2526	25	And you knew what it was, he is in love
30	2527	26	[Chorus]
30	2528	27	You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
30	2529	28	You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
30	2530	29	You can see it with the lights out (See it with the lights out), lights out (Lights out)
30	2531	30	You are in love, true love, you are in love
30	2532	31	
30	2533	32	[Bridge]
30	2534	33	And so it goes
30	2535	34	You two are dancing in a snow globe 'round and 'round
30	2536	35	And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
30	2537	36	And you understand now
30	2538	37	Why they lost their minds and fought the wars
30	2539	38	And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words
30	2540	39	
30	2541	40	[Interlude]
30	2542	41	'Cause you can hear it in the silence
30	2543	42	You can feel it on the way home
30	2544	43	You can see it with the lights out
30	2545	44	You are in love, true love, you are in love
30	2546	45	
30	2547	46	[Chorus]
30	2548	47	You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
30	2549	48	You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
30	2550	49	You can see it with the lights out (See it with the lights out), lights out (Lights out)
30	2551	50	You are in love, true love, you are in love (Ah)
30	2552	51	You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you (Ah)
30	2553	52	You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you (Ah)
30	2554	53	You can see it with the lights out (See it with the lights out), lights out (Lights out)
30	2555	54	You are in love, true love, you are in love
31	1699	1	[Verse 1]
31	1700	2	We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
31	1701	3	We wait for trains that just aren't comin'
31	1702	4	We show off our different scarlet letters
31	1703	5	Trust me, mine is better
31	1704	6	We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin
31	1705	7	We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doin'
31	1706	8	We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
31	1707	9	Honey, life is just a classroom
31	1708	10	Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
31	1709	11	
31	1710	12	[Chorus]
31	1711	13	'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
31	1712	14	Out of all the bricks they threw at me
31	1713	15	And evеry day is like a battle
31	1714	16	But evеry night with us is like a dream
31	1715	17	Baby, we're the new romantics, come on, come along with me
31	1716	18	Heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly
31	1717	19	We are too busy dancin' to get knocked off our feet
31	1718	20	Baby, we're the new romantics
31	1719	21	The best people in life are free
31	1720	22	
31	1721	23	[Verse 2]
31	1722	24	We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
31	1723	25	We hang back, it's all in the timing
31	1724	26	It's poker, he can't see it in my face
31	1725	27	But I'm about to play my Ace, ah
31	1726	28	We need love, but all we want is danger
31	1727	29	We team up, then switch sides like a record changer
31	1728	30	The rumors are terrible and cruel
31	1729	31	But, honey, most of them are true
31	1730	32	Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
31	1731	33	[Chorus]
31	1732	34	'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
31	1733	35	Out of all the bricks they threw at me

31	1735	37	But every night with us is like a dream
31	1736	38	Baby, we're the new romantics, come on, come along with me
31	1737	39	Heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly
31	1738	40	We are too busy dancin' (Yeah) to get knocked off our feet (Hey)
31	1739	41	Baby, we're the new romantics
31	1740	42	The best people in life are free

31	1749	51	Please, take my hand and
31	1750	52	Please, take me dancin' and
31	1751	53	Please, leave me stranded
31	1752	54	It's so romantic (It's so romantic)
31	1753	55	Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
31	1754	56

32	2067	1	[From The Vault]
32	2068	2	Flamingo pink, Sunrise Boulevard
32	2069	3	Clink, clink, being this young is art
32	2070	4	Aquamarine, moonlit swimmin' pool
32	2071	5	What if all I need is you?
32	2072	6	
32	2073	7	[Pre-Chorus]
32	2074	8	Got love-struck, went straight to my head
32	2075	9	Got lovesick all over my bed
32	2076	10	Love to think you’ll never forget
32	2077	11	Handprints in wet cement
32	2078	12	Adorned with smoke on my clothes
32	2079	13	Lovelorn and nobody knows
32	2080	14	Love thorns all over this rose
32	2081	15	I'll pay the price, you won't
32	2082	16	
32	2083	17	[Chorus]
32	2084	18	But if I’m all dressed up
32	2085	19	They might as well be lookin' at us
32	2086	20	And if they call me a slut
32	2087	21	You know it might be worth it for once
32	2088	22	And if I'm gonna be drunk
32	2089	23	I might as well be drunk in love
32	2090	24	[Verse 2]
32	2091	25	Send the code, he's waitin' there
32	2092	26	The sticks and stones they throw froze mid-air
32	2093	27	Everyone wants him, that was my crime
32	2094	28	The wrong place at the right time
32	2095	29	And I break down, then he's pullin' me in
32	2096	30	In a world of boys, he's a gentleman
32	2097	31	[Pre-Chorus]
32	2098	32	Got love-struck, went straight to my head (Straight to my head)
32	2099	33	Got lovesick all over my bed (Over my bed)

32	2103	37	[Chorus]
32	2104	38	But if I'm all dressed up (If I’m all dressed up)
32	2105	39	They might as well be lookin' at us (Lookin' at us)
32	2106	40	And if they call me a slut (If they call me a slut)
32	2107	41	You know it might be worth it for once (Worth it for once)
32	2108	42	And if I'm gonna be drunk
32	2109	43	I might as well be drunk in love
32	2110	44	
32	2111	45	[Bridge]
32	2112	46	Half asleep
32	2113	47	Takin’ your time in the tangerine
32	2114	48	Neon light, this is luxury
32	2115	49	You're not sayin' you're in love with me
32	2116	50	But you're goin' to
32	2117	51	Half awake
32	2118	52	Takin' your chance, it's a big mistake
32	2119	53	I said, "It might blow up in your pretty face"
32	2120	54	I'm not sayin', "Do it anyway" (Do it anyway)
32	2121	55	But you're going to
32	2122	56	[Outro]
32	2123	57	(Up)
32	2124	58	And if they call me a (Slut)
32	2125	59	You know it might be worth it for once

32	2127	61	I might as well be drunk in love
33	1893	1	[From The Vault]
33	1894	2	I've known it from the very start
33	1895	3	We’re a shot in the darkest dark
33	1896	4	Oh no, oh no, I'm unarmed
33	1897	5	The waiting is a sadness
33	1898	6	Fading into madness
33	1899	7	Oh no, oh no, it won't stop
33	1900	8	
33	1901	9	[Refrain]
33	1902	10	I’m standin' on a tightrope alone
33	1903	11	I hold my breath a little bit longer
33	1904	12	Halfway out the door, but it won't close
33	1905	13	I'm holdin' out hope for you to
33	1906	14	
33	1907	15	[Pre-Chorus]
33	1908	16	Say, "Don't go"
33	1909	17	I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go"
33	1910	18	
33	1911	19	[Chorus]
33	1912	20	Why'd you have to lead me on?
33	1913	21	Why’d you have to twist the knife?
33	1914	22	Walk away and leave me bleedin’, bleedin'?
33	1915	23	Why’d you whisper in the dark
33	1916	24	Just to leave me in the night?
33	1917	25	Now your silence has me screamin', screamin'
33	1918	26	[Post-Chorus]
33	1919	27	(Say) Say, "(Don't) don’t (Go) go"
33	1920	28	I would stay forevеr if you (Say) say, "(Don't) don't (Go) go"

33	1922	30	
33	1923	31	[Verse 2]
33	1924	32	Now I'm pacin' on shaky ground
33	1925	33	Strike a match, then you blow it out
33	1926	34	Oh no, oh no, it's not fair
33	1927	35	'Cause you kiss mе and it stops time
33	1928	36	And I'm yours, but you're not mine
33	1929	37	Oh no, oh no, you're not there
33	1930	38	
33	1931	39	[Refrain]
33	1932	40	I'm standin' on the sidewalk alone
33	1933	41	I wait for you to drive by
33	1934	42	I'm tryna see the cards that you won't show
33	1935	43	I'm about to fold unless you

33	1952	60	
33	1953	61	[Bridge]
33	1954	62	Why'd you have to (Why'd you have to)
33	1955	63	Make me want you? (Make me want you)
33	1956	64	Why'd you have to (Why'd you have to)
33	1957	65	Give me nothin' back?
33	1958	66	Why'd you have to (Why'd you have to)
33	1959	67	Make me love you? (Make me love you)
33	1960	68	I said, "I love you" (I said, "I love you")
33	1961	69	You say nothin' back
33	1962	70

33	1975	83	[Outro]
33	1976	84	But you won't, but you won't, but you won't

33	1978	86	But you won't, but you won't, but you won't
34	1769	1	[From The Vault]
34	1770	2	You went to a party
34	1771	3	I heard from everybody
34	1772	4	You part the crowd like the Red Sea
34	1773	5	Don't even get me started
34	1774	6	Did you get anxious though
34	1775	7	On the way home?
34	1776	8	I guess I'll never, ever know
34	1777	9	Now that we don't talk
34	1778	10	
34	1779	11	[Verse 2]
34	1780	12	You grew your hair long
34	1781	13	You got new icons
34	1782	14	And from the outside
34	1783	15	It looks like you're tryin' lives on
34	1784	16	I miss the old ways
34	1785	17	You didn't have to change
34	1786	18	But I guess I don't have a say
34	1787	19	Now that we don't talk
34	1788	20	
34	1789	21	[Chorus]
34	1790	22	I call my mom, she said that it was for the best
34	1791	23	Remind myself, the morе I gave, you'd want me less
34	1792	24	I cannot bе your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost
34	1793	25	And what it cost, now that we don't talk
34	1794	26	[Bridge]
34	1795	27	What do you tell your friends we
34	1796	28	Shared dinners, long weekends with?
34	1797	29	Truth is, I can't pretend it's
34	1798	30	Platonic, it's just ended, so
34	1799	31	
34	1800	32	[Chorus]
34	1801	33	I call my mom, she said to get it off my chest (Off my chest)
34	1802	34	Remind myself the way you faded 'til I left (Until I left)
34	1803	35	I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost (Of what I lost)
34	1804	36	And what it cost, now that we don't talk
34	1805	37	
34	1806	38	[Outro]
34	1807	39	I don't have to pretend I like acid rock
34	1808	40	Or that I'd like to be on a mega yacht
34	1809	41	With important men who think important thoughts
34	1810	42	Guess maybe I am better off now that we don't talk
34	1811	43	And the only way back to my dignity
34	1812	44	Was to turn into a shrouded mystery
34	1813	45	Just like I had been when you were chasing me
34	1814	46	Guess this is how it has to be now that we don't talk
35	2186	1	[From The Vault]
35	2187	2	You had people who called you on unmarked numbers
35	2188	3	In my peripheral vision
35	2189	4	I let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer
35	2190	5	All was quickly forgiven
35	2191	6	You were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious
35	2192	7	Flush with the currency of cool
35	2193	8	I was always turnin' out my empty pockets
35	2194	9	And when it came to you
35	2195	10	
35	2196	11	[Chorus]
35	2197	12	I didn't come here to make friends
35	2198	13	We were born to be suburban legends
35	2199	14	When you hold me, it holds me together
35	2200	15	And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever
35	2201	16	
35	2202	17	[Verse 2]
35	2203	18	I had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs
35	2204	19	Would surprise the whole school
35	2205	20	When I ended up back at our class reunion
35	2206	21	Walkin' in with you
35	2207	22	You'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries
35	2208	23	With the pages ripped out
35	2209	24	I am standin' in a 1950s gymnasium
35	2210	25	And I can still see you now
35	2211	26	[Chorus]
35	2212	27	I didn't come here to make friends
35	2213	28	We were born to be suburban legends
35	2214	29	When you hold me, it holds me together
35	2215	30	And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever
35	2216	31	I know that you still remember
35	2217	32	We were born to be national treasures
35	2218	33	When you told me we'd get back together
35	2219	34	And you kissed me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever
35	2220	35	
35	2221	36	[Outro]
35	2222	37	Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block
35	2223	38	I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it
35	2224	39	Waves crash on the shore, I dash to the door
35	2225	40	You don't knock anymore and my whole life's ruined
35	2226	41	Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block
35	2227	42	I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it
35	2228	43	Waves crash to the shore, I dash to the door
35	2229	44	You don't knock anymore and I always knew it
35	2230	45	That my life would be ruined

36	1533	5	Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
36	1534	6	With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
36	1535	7	I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
36	1536	8	You still wouldn't go

36	1539	11	Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
36	1540	12	I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
36	1541	13	You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
36	1542	14	You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby
36	1543	15	
36	1544	16	[Chorus]
36	1545	17	Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
36	1546	18	Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
36	1547	19	"Come here," I whispered in your ear
36	1548	20	In your dream as you passеd out, baby
36	1549	21	Was it over then? And is it over now?

36	1555	27	Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
36	1556	28	Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
36	1557	29	Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
36	1558	30	Your new girl is my clone
36	1559	31	[Bridge]
36	1560	32	And did you think I didn't see you?
36	1561	33	There were flashin' lights
36	1562	34	At least I had the decency
36	1563	35	To keep my nights out of sight
36	1564	36	Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
36	1565	37	And my whispered sighs
36	1566	38	Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
36	1567	39	Off of very tall somethings
36	1568	40	Just to see you come runnin'
36	1569	41	And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

36	1571	43	[Pre-Chorus]
36	1572	44	Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
36	1573	45	If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
36	1574	46	You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)

36	1576	48	
36	1577	49	[Chorus]
36	1578	50	Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
36	1579	51	Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?

36	1581	53	In your dream as you passed out, baby

36	1603	75	(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
36	1604	76	And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
36	1605	77	I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
36	1606	78	But no

37	1061	2	
37	1062	3	How does a person reinvеnt herself, you ask? In any way I could think of. Musically, geographically, aesthetically, behaviorally, motivationally... And I did so joyfully. The curiosity I had felt the first murmurs of while making Red amplified into a pulsi
37	1063	4	
37	1064	5	You see—in the years preceding this, I had become the target of slut-shaming—the intensity and relentlessness of which would be criticized and called out if it happened today, the jokes about my amount of boyfriends. The trivialization of my songwriting as
37	1065	6	
37	1066	7	It became clear to me that for me there was no such thing as casual dating, or even having a male friend who you platonically hang out with. If I was seen with him, it was assumed I was sleeping with him. And so I swore off hanging out with guys, dating, f
37	1067	8	
37	1068	9	Being a consummate optimist, I assumed I could fix this if I simply changed my behavior. I swore off dating and decided to focus only on myself, my music, my growth, and my female friendships. If I only hung out with my female friends, people couldn’t sens
37	1069	10	
37	1070	11	But none of that mattered then because I had a plan and I had a demeanor as trusting as a basket of golden retriever puppies. I had the keys to my own apartment in New York and I had new melodies bursting from my imagination. I had Max Martin and Shellback
37	1071	12	
37	1072	13	There was so much that I didn't know then, and looking back I see what a good thing that was. This time of my life was marked by right kind of naïveté, a hunger for adventure, and a sense of freedom I hadn't tasted before. It turns out that the cocktail of
37	1073	14	
37	1074	15	I'll always be so incredibly grateful for how you loved and embraced this album. You, who followed my zig zag creative choices and cheered on my risks and experiments. You, who heard the wink and humor in "Blank Space" and maybe even empathized with the pa
37	1075	16	
37	1076	17	I was born in 1989, reinvented for the first time in 2014, and a part of me was reclaimed in 2023 with the re-release of this album I love so dearly. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine the magic you would sprinkle on my life for so long.
37	1077	18	
37	1078	19	This moment is a reflection of the woods we've wandered through and all this love between us still glowing in the darkest dark.
37	1079	20	
37	1080	21	I present to you, with gratitude and wild wonder, my version of 1989.
37	1081	22	
37	1082	23	It's been waiting for you.

115	8869	1	[Verse 1]
115	8870	2	I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
115	8871	3	Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
115	8872	4	And if it was an open-shut case
115	8873	5	I never would've known from that look on your face
115	8874	6	Lost in your current like a priceless wine
115	8875	7	
115	8876	8	[Chorus]
115	8877	9	The more that you say, the less I know
115	8878	10	Wherever you stray, I follow
115	8879	11	I'm begging for you to take my hand
115	8880	12	Wreck my plans, that's my man
115	8881	13	
115	8882	14	[Verse 2]
115	8883	15	Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
115	8884	16	Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
115	8885	17	As if you were a mythical thing
115	8886	18	Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
115	8887	19	And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
115	8888	20	
115	8889	21	[Chorus]
115	8890	22	The more that you say, the less I know
115	8891	23	Wherever you stray, I follow
115	8892	24	I'm begging for you to take my hand
115	8893	25	Wreck my plans, that's my man
115	8894	26	You know that my train could take you home
115	8895	27	Anywhere else is hollow
115	8896	28	I'm begging for you to take my hand
115	8897	29	Wreck my plans, that's my man
115	8898	30	[Bridge]
115	8899	31	Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
115	8900	32	They count me out time and time again
115	8901	33	Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
115	8902	34	But I come back stronger than a '90s trend
115	8903	35	
115	8904	36	[Verse 3]
115	8905	37	Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
115	8906	38	Show me the places where the others gave you scars
115	8907	39	Now this is an open-shut case
115	8908	40	I guess I should've known from the look on your face
115	8909	41	Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

115	8915	47	Wreck my plans, that's my man
115	8916	48	You know that my train could take you home
115	8917	49	Anywhere else is hollow
115	8918	50	I'm begging for you to take my hand
115	8919	51	Wreck my plans, that's my man
115	8920	52	The more that you say, the less I know
115	8921	53	Wherever you stray, I follow
115	8922	54	I'm begging for you to take my hand
115	8923	55	Wreck my plans, that's my man
115	8924	56	You know that my train could take you home
115	8925	57	Anywhere else is hollow
115	8926	58	I'm begging for you to take my hand
115	8927	59	Wreck my plans, that's my man
115	8928	60	[Outro]
115	8929	61	Hey, that's my man
115	8930	62	That's my man
115	8931	63	Yeah, that's my man
115	8932	64	Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
115	8933	65	That's my man
115	8934	66	Hey, that's my man
115	8935	67	I'm begging for you to take my hand
115	8936	68	Wreck my plans, that's my man10
116	7922	1	[Verse 1]
116	7923	2	You booked the night train for a reason
116	7924	3	So you could sit there in this hurt
116	7925	4	Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
116	7926	5	You're not sure which is worse
116	7927	6	
116	7928	7	[Chorus]
116	7929	8	Because I dropped your hand while dancing
116	7930	9	Left you out there standing
116	7931	10	Crestfallen on the landing
116	7932	11	Champagne problems
116	7933	12	Your mom's ring in your pocket
116	7934	13	My picture in your wallet
116	7935	14	Your heart was glass, I dropped it
116	7936	15	Champagne problems
116	7937	16	
116	7938	17	[Verse 2]
116	7939	18	You told your family for a reason
116	7940	19	You couldn't keep it in
116	7941	20	Your sister splashed out on the bottle
116	7942	21	Now no one's celebrating
116	7943	22	
116	7944	23	[Chorus]
116	7945	24	Dom Pérignon, you brought it
116	7946	25	No crowd of friends applauded
116	7947	26	Your hometown skeptics called it
116	7948	27	Champagne problems
116	7949	28	You had a speech, you're speechless
116	7950	29	Love slipped beyond your reaches
116	7951	30	And I couldn't give a reason
116	7952	31	Champagne problems
116	7953	32	[Bridge]
116	7954	33	Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
116	7955	34	November flush and your flannel cure
116	7956	35	"This dorm was once a madhouse"
116	7957	36	I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"
116	7958	37	How evergreen, our group of friends
116	7959	38	Don't think we'll say that word again
116	7960	39	And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
116	7961	40	That we once walked through
116	7962	41	One for the money, two for the show
116	7963	42	I never was ready so I watch you go
116	7964	43	Sometimes you just don't know the answer
116	7965	44	'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
116	7966	45	"She would've made such a lovely bride
116	7967	46	What a shame she's fucked in the head," they said
116	7968	47	But you'll find the real thing instead
116	7969	48	She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred
116	7970	49	
116	7971	50	[Chorus]
116	7972	51	And hold your hand while dancing
116	7973	52	Never leave you standing
116	7974	53	Crestfallen on the landing
116	7975	54	With champagne problems
116	7976	55	Your mom's ring in your pocket
116	7977	56	Her picture in your wallet
116	7978	57	You won't remember all my
116	7979	58	Champagne problems
116	7980	59	[Outro]
116	7981	60	You won't remember all my
116	7982	61	Champagne problems11
117	8311	1	[Intro]
117	8312	2	Gleaming, twinkling
117	8313	3	Eyes like sinking ships on waters
117	8314	4	So inviting, I almost jump in
117	8315	5	
117	8316	6	[Chorus]
117	8317	7	But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
117	8318	8	I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
117	8319	9	I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
117	8320	10	Everybody wants you
117	8321	11	Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
117	8322	12	Walk past, quick brush
117	8323	13	I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
117	8324	14	I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
117	8325	15	Everybody wants you
117	8326	16	But I don't like a gold rush
117	8327	17	
117	8328	18	[Verse 1]
117	8329	19	What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
117	8330	20	With your hair falling into place like dominoes
117	8331	21	I see me padding across your wooden floors
117	8332	22	With my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door
117	8333	23	
117	8334	24	[Refrain]
117	8335	25	At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit
117	8336	26	And the coastal town we wandered 'round had nеver seen a love as pure as it
117	8337	27	And thеn it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
117	8338	28	'Cause it could never be
117	8339	29	[Chorus]
117	8340	30	'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
117	8341	31	I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
117	8342	32	I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
117	8343	33	Everybody wants you
117	8344	34	Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
117	8345	35	Walk past, quick brush
117	8346	36	I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
117	8347	37	I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
117	8348	38	Everybody wants you
117	8349	39	But I don't like a gold rush
117	8350	40	
117	8351	41	[Verse 2]
117	8352	42	What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
117	8353	43	With your hair falling into place like dominoes
117	8354	44	My mind turns your life into folklore
117	8355	45	I can't dare to dream about you anymore
117	8356	46	
117	8357	47	[Refrain]
117	8358	48	At dinner parties, I won't call you out on your contrarian shit
117	8359	49	And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it
117	8360	50	'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
117	8361	51	'Cause it will never be
117	8362	52	
117	8363	53	[Outro]
117	8364	54	Gleaming, twinkling
117	8365	55	Eyes like sinking ships on waters
117	8366	56	So inviting, I almost jump in5
118	8753	1	[Verse 1]
118	8754	2	If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
118	8755	3	While I was gone, I would've asked you
118	8756	4	It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass
118	8757	5	But I felt it when I passed you
118	8758	6	There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
118	8759	7	But if it's all the same to you
118	8760	8	It's the same to me
118	8761	9	
118	8762	10	[Chorus]
118	8763	11	So we could call it even
118	8764	12	You could call me "babe" for the weekend
118	8765	13	​'Tis the damn season, write this down
118	8766	14	I'm stayin' at my parents' house
118	8767	15	And the road not taken looks real good now
118	8768	16	And it always leads to you and my hometown
118	8769	17	
118	8770	18	[Verse 2]
118	8771	19	I parkеd my car right between the Methodist
118	8772	20	And thе school that used to be ours
118	8773	21	The holidays linger like bad perfume
118	8774	22	You can run, but only so far
118	8775	23	I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
118	8776	24	But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me
118	8777	25	
118	8778	26	[Chorus]
118	8779	27	We could call it even
118	8780	28	You could call me "babe" for the weekend
118	8781	29	​'Tis the damn season, write this down
118	8782	30	I'm stayin' at my parents' house
118	8783	31	And the road not taken looks real good now
118	8784	32	Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
118	8785	33	Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
118	8786	34	We could just ride around
118	8787	35	And the road not taken looks real good now
118	8788	36	And it always leads to you and my hometown
118	8789	37	[Bridge]
118	8790	38	Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
118	8791	39	I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
118	8792	40	So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
118	8793	41	Who'll write books about me if I ever make it
118	8794	42	And wonder about the only soul
118	8795	43	Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
118	8796	44	And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own
118	8797	45	To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
118	8798	46	We could call it even
118	8799	47	Even though I'm leaving
118	8800	48	And I'll be yours for the weekend
118	8801	49	​'Tis the damn season
118	8802	50	
118	8803	51	[Chorus]
118	8804	52	We could call it even
118	8805	53	You could call me "babe" for the weekend

118	8810	58	Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
118	8811	59	We could just ride around
118	8812	60	And the road not taken looks real good now
118	8813	61	And it always leads to you and my hometown
118	8814	62	[Outro]
118	8815	63	It always leads to you and my hometown5
119	8816	1	[Verse 1]
119	8817	2	I sit and watch you reading with your head low
119	8818	3	I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
119	8819	4	I sit and watch you
119	8820	5	I notice everything you do or don't do
119	8821	6	You're so much older and wiser, and I
119	8822	7	
119	8823	8	[Chorus 1]
119	8824	9	I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
119	8825	10	Use my best colors for your portrait
119	8826	11	Lay the table with the fancy shit
119	8827	12	And watch you tolerate it
119	8828	13	If it's all in my head, tell me now
119	8829	14	Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
119	8830	15	I know my love should be celebrated
119	8831	16	But you tolerate it
119	8832	17	
119	8833	18	[Verse 2]
119	8834	19	I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
119	8835	20	I take your indiscretions all in good fun
119	8836	21	I sit and listеn, I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn
119	8837	22	You're so much older and wiser and I
119	8838	23	
119	8839	24	[Chorus 1]
119	8840	25	I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
119	8841	26	Use my best colors for your portrait
119	8842	27	Lay the table with the fancy shit
119	8843	28	And watch you tolerate it

119	8845	30	Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
119	8846	31	I know my love should be celebrated
119	8847	32	But you tolerate it
119	8848	33	[Bridge]
119	8849	34	While you were out building other worlds, where was I?
119	8850	35	Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
119	8851	36	I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
119	8852	37	Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
119	8853	38	Drawing hearts in the byline
119	8854	39	Always taking up too much space or time
119	8855	40	You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I
119	8856	41	
119	8857	42	[Chorus 2]
119	8858	43	Break free and leave us in ruins
119	8859	44	Took this dagger in me and removed it
119	8860	45	Gain the weight of you, then lose it
119	8861	46	Believe me, I could do it
119	8862	47	If it's all in my head, tell me now
119	8863	48	Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
119	8864	49	I know my love should be celebrated
119	8865	50	But you tolerate it
119	8866	51

120	8689	5	[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
120	8690	6	Este's a friend of mine
120	8691	7	We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
120	8692	8	Este's been losin' sleep
120	8693	9	Her husband's actin' different, and it smells like infidelity
120	8694	10	She says, "That ain't my Merlot on his mouth
120	8695	11	That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"
120	8696	12	No, there ain't no doubt
120	8697	13	I think I'm gonna call him out
120	8698	14	
120	8699	15	[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
120	8700	16	She says, "I think he did it, but I just can't prove it"
120	8701	17	I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
120	8702	18	I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
120	8703	19	No, no body, no crime
120	8704	20	But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die
120	8705	21	
120	8706	22	[Post-Chorus: HAIM]
120	8707	23	No, no
120	8708	24	I think he did it
120	8709	25	No, no
120	8710	26	He did it
120	8711	27	[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
120	8712	28	Este wasn't there Tuesday night at Olive Gardеn
120	8713	29	At her job or anywhere
120	8714	30	Hе reports his missing wife
120	8715	31	And I noticed when I passed his house
120	8716	32	His truck has got some brand new tires
120	8717	33	And his mistress moved in
120	8718	34	Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
120	8719	35	No, there ain't no doubt
120	8720	36	Somebody's gotta catch him out, 'cause
120	8721	37	
120	8722	38	[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
120	8723	39	I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
120	8724	40	I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
120	8725	41	I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
120	8726	42	No, no body, no crime
120	8727	43	But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die

120	8729	45	[Post-Chorus: HAIM & Taylor Swift]
120	8730	46	No, no
120	8731	47	I think he did it
120	8732	48	No, no
120	8733	49	He did it
120	8734	50	
120	8735	51	[Verse 3: Taylor Swift & Danielle Haim]
120	8736	52	Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
120	8737	53	And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
120	8738	54	Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me
120	8739	55	(She was with me, dude)
120	8740	56	Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy
120	8741	57	[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
120	8742	58	They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
120	8743	59	They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
120	8744	60	She thinks I did it, but she just can't prove it

120	8750	66	I wasn't lettin' up until the day he—
120	8751	67	No, no body, no crime
120	8752	68	I wasn't lettin' up until the day he died7
121	8367	1	[Verse 1]
121	8368	2	Honey, when I'm above the trees
121	8369	3	I see this for what it is
121	8370	4	But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given
121	8371	5	Is just shit we're dividin' up
121	8372	6	Showed you all of my hiding spots
121	8373	7	I was dancing when the music stopped
121	8374	8	And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention
121	8375	9	I haven't met the new me yet
121	8376	10	
121	8377	11	[Chorus]
121	8378	12	There'll be happiness after you
121	8379	13	But there was happiness because of you
121	8380	14	Both of these things can be true
121	8381	15	There is happiness
121	8382	16	
121	8383	17	[Post-Chorus]
121	8384	18	Past the blood and bruise
121	8385	19	Past the curses and cries
121	8386	20	Beyond the terror in the nightfall
121	8387	21	Haunted by the look in my eyes
121	8388	22	That would've loved you for a lifetime
121	8389	23	Leave it all behind
121	8390	24	And there is happiness
121	8391	25	
121	8392	26	[Verse 2]
121	8393	27	Tell me, when did your winning smile
121	8394	28	Begin to look like a smirk?
121	8395	29	When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
121	8396	30	Pointed at my deepest hurt?
121	8397	31	I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
121	8398	32	Who takes my spot next to you
121	8399	33	No, I didn't mean that
121	8400	34	Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury
121	8401	35	You haven't met the new me yet
121	8402	36	[Chorus]
121	8403	37	There'll be happiness after me
121	8404	38	But there was happiness because of me
121	8405	39	Both of these things, I believe
121	8406	40	There is happiness
121	8407	41	
121	8408	42	[Post-Chorus]
121	8409	43	In our history, across our great divide
121	8410	44	There is a glorious sunrise
121	8411	45	Dappled with the flickers of light
121	8412	46	From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
121	8413	47	And there is happiness
121	8414	48	
121	8415	49	[Bridge]
121	8416	50	I can't make it go away by making you a villain
121	8417	51	I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
121	8418	52	And I pulled your body into mine
121	8419	53	Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties
121	8420	54	No one teaches you what to do
121	8421	55	When a good man hurts you
121	8422	56	And you know you hurt him too
121	8423	57	
121	8424	58	[Verse 3]
121	8425	59	Honey, when I'm above the trees
121	8426	60	I see it for what it is
121	8427	61	But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
121	8428	62	After giving you the best I had
121	8429	63	Tell me what to give after that
121	8430	64	All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
121	8431	65	You haven't met the new me yet
121	8432	66	And I think she'll give you that
121	8433	67	[Chorus]
121	8434	68	There'll be happiness after you
121	8435	69	But there was happiness because of you too
121	8436	70	Both of these things can be true
121	8437	71	There is happiness
121	8438	72	
121	8439	73	[Post-Chorus]
121	8440	74	In our history, across our great divide
121	8441	75	There is a glorious sunrise
121	8442	76	Dappled with the flickers of light
121	8443	77	From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
121	8444	78	Oh, leave it all behind
121	8445	79	Leave it all behind
121	8446	80	And there is happiness4
122	8186	1	[Verse 1]
122	8187	2	Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
122	8188	3	When we were younger, down in the park
122	8189	4	Honey, makin' a lark of the misery
122	8190	5	You got shiny friends since you left town
122	8191	6	A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
122	8192	7	And I got nothin' but well wishes for ya
122	8193	8	
122	8194	9	[Pre-Chorus]
122	8195	10	Ooh
122	8196	11	This place is the same as it ever was
122	8197	12	Ooh
122	8198	13	But you won't like it that way
122	8199	14	
122	8200	15	[Chorus]
122	8201	16	It's never too late to come back to my side
122	8202	17	The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
122	8203	18	And if you're ever tired of bеin' known for who you know
122	8204	19	You know that you'll always know me
122	8205	20	Dorothea, uh-uh
122	8206	21	Dorothea, ah-ah
122	8207	22	
122	8208	23	[Post-Chorus]
122	8209	24	Ooh
122	8210	25	You'rе a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' makeup and magazines
122	8211	26	Ooh
122	8212	27	From you, I'd buy anything
122	8213	28	[Verse 2]
122	8214	29	Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
122	8215	30	When it was calmer, skippin' the prom
122	8216	31	Just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
122	8217	32	And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya
122	8218	33	But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers? Well
122	8219	34	
122	8220	35	[Pre-Chorus]
122	8221	36	Ooh
122	8222	37	I guess I'll never know
122	8223	38	Ooh
122	8224	39	And you'll go on with the show
122	8225	40	
122	8226	41	[Chorus]
122	8227	42	But it's never too late to come back to my side
122	8228	43	The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
122	8229	44	And if you're ever tired of bein' known for who you know
122	8230	45	You know, you'll always know me
122	8231	46	Dorothea, uh-uh
122	8232	47	Dorothea, ah-ah
122	8233	48	
122	8234	49	[Outro]
122	8235	50	Ooh, ooh
122	8236	51	Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
122	8237	52	Ooh, ooh
122	8238	53	Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
122	8239	54	Dorothea (Ah-ah-ah)
122	8240	55	Ah-ah
122	8241	56	Ooh4
123	8032	1	[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
123	8033	2	Break my soul in two looking for you
123	8034	3	But you're right here
123	8035	4	If I can't relate to you anymore
123	8036	5	Then who am I related to?
123	8037	6	And if this is the long haul
123	8038	7	How'd we get here so soon?
123	8039	8	Did I close my fist around something delicate?
123	8040	9	Did I shatter you?
123	8041	10	
123	8042	11	[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
123	8043	12	And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
123	8044	13	Wondering where did my baby go?
123	8045	14	The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
123	8046	15	Sorry for not making you my centerfold
123	8047	16	
123	8048	17	[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
123	8049	18	Over and over
123	8050	19	Lost again with no surprises
123	8051	20	Disappointments, close your eyes
123	8052	21	And it gets colder and colder
123	8053	22	When the sun goes down
123	8054	23	
123	8055	24	[Verse 2: Matt Berninger with Taylor Swift]
123	8056	25	The question pounds my head
123	8057	26	What's a lifetime of achievement
123	8058	27	If I pushed you to the edge?
123	8059	28	But you were too polite to leave me
123	8060	29	And do you miss the rogue
123	8061	30	Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
123	8062	31	Will you forgive my soul
123	8063	32	When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?
123	8064	33	[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Matt Berninger]
123	8065	34	'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
123	8066	35	It was the one place to be
123	8067	36	The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
123	8068	37	Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring
123	8069	38	
123	8070	39	[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
123	8071	40	Over and over
123	8072	41	Lost again with no surprises
123	8073	42	Disappointments, close your eyes
123	8074	43	And it gets colder and colder
123	8075	44	When the sun goes down
123	8076	45	
123	8077	46	[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Matt Berninger, Both]
123	8078	47	Were you waiting at our old spot
123	8079	48	In the tree line
123	8080	49	By the gold clock
123	8081	50	Did I leave you hanging every single day?
123	8082	51	Were you standing in the hallway
123	8083	52	With a big cake, happy birthday
123	8084	53	Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
123	8085	54	A universe away
123	8086	55	And when I got into the accident
123	8087	56	The sight that flashed before me was your face
123	8088	57	But when I walked up to the podium, I think that I forgot to say your name
123	8089	58	[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
123	8090	59	I'm on a bench in Coney Island
123	8091	60	Wondering where did my baby go?
123	8092	61	The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
123	8093	62	Sorry for not making you my centerfold
123	8094	63	
123	8095	64	[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
123	8096	65	Over and over
123	8097	66	Lost again with no surprises
123	8098	67	Disappointments, close your eyes
123	8099	68	And it gets colder and colder
123	8100	69	When the sun goes down
123	8101	70	
123	8102	71	[Outro: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
123	8103	72	When the sun goes down
123	8104	73	The sight that flashed before me was your face
123	8105	74	When the sun goes down
123	8106	75	But I think that I forgot to say your name
123	8107	76	Over and over
123	8108	77	Sorry for not making you my, making you my
123	8109	78	Making you my centerfold5
124	8447	1	[Verse 1]
124	8448	2	How's one to know?
124	8449	3	I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
124	8450	4	In a faith-forgotten land
124	8451	5	In from the snow
124	8452	6	Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
124	8453	7	Tarnished but so grand
124	8454	8	
124	8455	9	[Pre-Chorus]
124	8456	10	And the old widow goes to the stone every day
124	8457	11	But I don't, I just sit here and wait
124	8458	12	Grieving for the living
124	8459	13	
124	8460	14	[Chorus]
124	8461	15	Oh, goddamn
124	8462	16	My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
124	8463	17	Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
124	8464	18	Oh, I can't
124	8465	19	Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
124	8466	20	My house of stone, your ivy grows
124	8467	21	And now I'm covered in you
124	8468	22	
124	8469	23	[Verse 2]
124	8470	24	I wish to know
124	8471	25	The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
124	8472	26	Magnificently cursed
124	8473	27	He's in the room
124	8474	28	Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
124	8475	29	He wants what's only yours
124	8476	30	[Chorus]
124	8477	31	Oh, goddamn
124	8478	32	My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
124	8479	33	Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
124	8480	34	Oh, I can't
124	8481	35	Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
124	8482	36	My house of stone, your ivy grows
124	8483	37	And now I'm covered
124	8484	38	
124	8485	39	[Verse 3]
124	8486	40	Clover blooms in the fields
124	8487	41	Spring breaks loose, the time is near
124	8488	42	What would he do if he found us out?
124	8489	43	Crescent moon, coast is clear
124	8490	44	Spring breaks loose, but so does fear
124	8491	45	He's gonna burn this house to the ground
124	8492	46	How's one to know?
124	8493	47	I'd live and die for moments that we stole
124	8494	48	On begged and borrowed time
124	8495	49	So tell me to run
124	8496	50	Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
124	8497	51	And drink my husband's wine
124	8498	52	
124	8499	53	[Chorus]
124	8500	54	Oh, goddamn
124	8501	55	My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
124	8502	56	Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
124	8503	57	Oh, I can't
124	8504	58	Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
124	8505	59	My house of stone, your ivy grows
124	8506	60	And now I'm covered in you
124	8507	61	And I'm covered in you
124	8508	62	[Bridge]
124	8509	63	So yeah, it's a fire
124	8510	64	It's a goddamn blaze in the dark
124	8511	65	And you started it
124	8512	66	You started it
124	8513	67	So yeah, it's a war
124	8514	68	It's the goddamn fight of my life
124	8515	69	And you started it
124	8516	70	You started it
124	8517	71	
124	8518	72	[Chorus]
124	8519	73	Oh, I can't
124	8520	74	Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
124	8521	75	My house of stone, your ivy grows
124	8522	76	And now I'm covered
124	8523	77	In you, in you
124	8524	78	Now I'm covered in you
124	8525	79	In you5
125	8110	1	[Verse 1]
125	8111	2	And the tennis court was covered up
125	8112	3	With some tent-like thing
125	8113	4	And you asked me to dance
125	8114	5	But I said, "Dancin' is a dangerous game"
125	8115	6	Oh, I thought
125	8116	7	This is gonna be one of those things
125	8117	8	Now I know
125	8118	9	I'm never gonna love again
125	8119	10	
125	8120	11	[Refrain]
125	8121	12	I've got some tricks up my sleeve
125	8122	13	Takes one to know one
125	8123	14	You're a cowboy like me
125	8124	15	
125	8125	16	[Verse 2]
125	8126	17	Never wanted love
125	8127	18	Just a fancy car
125	8128	19	Now I'm waiting by the phone
125	8129	20	Like I'm sitting in an airport bar
125	8130	21	[Refrain]
125	8131	22	You had some tricks up your sleeve
125	8132	23	Takes one to know one
125	8133	24	You're a cowboy like me
125	8134	25	[Chorus]
125	8135	26	Perched in the dark
125	8136	27	Tellin' all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
125	8137	28	Like it could be love
125	8138	29	I could be the way forward
125	8139	30	Only if they pay for it
125	8140	31	You're a bandit like me
125	8141	32	Eyes full of stars
125	8142	33	Hustling for the good life
125	8143	34	Never thought I'd meet you here
125	8144	35	It could be love
125	8145	36	We could be the way forward
125	8146	37	And I know I'll pay for it
125	8147	38	
125	8148	39	[Chorus]
125	8149	40	You're a cowboy like me
125	8150	41	Perched in the dark
125	8151	42	Tellin' all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
125	8152	43	Like it could be love
125	8153	44	I could be the way forward

125	8158	49	Never thought I'd meet you here
125	8159	50	It could be love
125	8160	51	We could be the way forward
125	8161	52	And I know I'll pay for it
125	8162	53	[Bridge]
125	8163	54	And the skeletons in both our closets
125	8164	55	Plotted hard to fuck this up
125	8165	56	And the old men that I've swindled
125	8166	57	Really did believe I was the one
125	8167	58	And the ladies lunchin' have their stories about
125	8168	59	When you passed through town
125	8169	60	Oh, but that was all before I locked it down
125	8170	61	
125	8171	62	[Verse 3]
125	8172	63	Now you hang from my lips
125	8173	64	Like the Gardens of Babylon
125	8174	65	With your boots beneath my bed
125	8175	66	Forever is the sweetest con
125	8176	67	
125	8177	68	[Refrain]
125	8178	69	I've had some tricks up my sleeve
125	8179	70	Takes one to know one

125	8181	72	
125	8182	73	[Outro]
125	8183	74	And I'm never gonna love again
125	8184	75	I'm never gonna love again
125	8185	76	I'm never gonna love again6
126	8526	1	[Verse 1]
126	8527	2	Fatefully
126	8528	3	I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me
126	8529	4	Misery
126	8530	5	Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
126	8531	6	And you passed right by
126	8532	7	I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
126	8533	8	The knife cuts both ways
126	8534	9	If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break
126	8535	10	
126	8536	11	[Chorus]
126	8537	12	And I fell from the pedestal
126	8538	13	Right down the rabbit hole
126	8539	14	Long story short, it was a bad time
126	8540	15	Pushed from the precipice
126	8541	16	Clung to the nearest lips
126	8542	17	Long story short, it was the wrong guy
126	8543	18	
126	8544	19	[Post-Chorus]
126	8545	20	Now I'm all about you
126	8546	21	I'm all about you, ah
126	8547	22	Yeah, yeah
126	8548	23	I'm all about you, ah
126	8549	24	Yeah, yeah
126	8550	25	
126	8551	26	[Verse 2]
126	8552	27	Actually
126	8553	28	I always felt I must look better in the rear view
126	8554	29	Missing me
126	8555	30	At the golden gates they once held the keys to
126	8556	31	When I dropped my sword
126	8557	32	I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
126	8558	33	And we live in peace
126	8559	34	But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready
126	8560	35	[Chorus]
126	8561	36	'Cause I fell from the pedestal
126	8562	37	Right down the rabbit hole
126	8563	38	Long story short, it was a bad time
126	8564	39	Pushed from the precipice
126	8565	40	Clung to the nearest lips
126	8566	41	Long story short, it was the wrong guy
126	8567	42	
126	8568	43	[Post-Chorus]
126	8569	44	Now I'm all about you
126	8570	45	I'm all about you, ah
126	8571	46	Yeah, yeah
126	8572	47	I'm all about you
126	8573	48	
126	8574	49	[Bridge]
126	8575	50	No more keepin' score
126	8576	51	Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
126	8577	52	No more tug of war
126	8578	53	Now I just know there's more (Know there's more)
126	8579	54	No more keepin' score
126	8580	55	Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
126	8581	56	And my waves meet your shore
126	8582	57	Ever and evermore
126	8583	58	
126	8584	59	[Verse 3]
126	8585	60	Past me
126	8586	61	I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
126	8587	62	Your nemeses
126	8588	63	Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
126	8589	64	And he's passing by
126	8590	65	Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
126	8591	66	And he feels like home
126	8592	67	If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go
126	8593	68	[Chorus]
126	8594	69	And I fell from the pedestal
126	8595	70	Right down the rabbit hole
126	8596	71	Long story short, it was a bad time
126	8597	72	Pushed from the precipice
126	8598	73	Climbed right back up the cliff
126	8599	74	Long story short, I survived
126	8600	75	
126	8601	76	[Post-Chorus]
126	8602	77	Now I'm all about you
126	8603	78	(And now) I'm all about you, ah
126	8604	79	(And now) I'm all about you
126	8605	80	(And now) I'm all about you, ah
126	8606	81	Yeah, yeah
126	8607	82	I'm all about you
126	8608	83	(And now) Yeah, yeah
126	8609	84	I'm all about you
126	8610	85	
126	8611	86	[Outro]
126	8612	87	Long story short, it was a bad time
126	8613	88	Long story short, I survived4
127	8614	1	[Verse 1]
127	8615	2	Never be so kind
127	8616	3	You forget to be clever
127	8617	4	Never be so clever
127	8618	5	You forget to be kind
127	8619	6	
127	8620	7	[Pre-Chorus]
127	8621	8	And if I didn't know better
127	8622	9	I'd think you were talking to me now
127	8623	10	If I didn't know better
127	8624	11	I'd think you were still around
127	8625	12	
127	8626	13	[Chorus]
127	8627	14	What died didn't stay dead
127	8628	15	What died didn't stay dead
127	8629	16	You're alive, you're alive in my head
127	8630	17	What died didn't stay dead
127	8631	18	What died didn't stay dead
127	8632	19	You're alive, so alive
127	8633	20	
127	8634	21	[Verse 2]
127	8635	22	Never be so politе
127	8636	23	You forget your power
127	8637	24	Nevеr wield such power
127	8638	25	You forget to be polite
127	8639	26	[Pre-Chorus]
127	8640	27	And if I didn't know better
127	8641	28	I'd think you were listening to me now
127	8642	29	If I didn't know better
127	8643	30	I'd think you were still around
127	8644	31

127	8649	36	What died didn't stay dead
127	8650	37	What died didn't stay dead
127	8651	38	You're alive, so alive
127	8652	39	
127	8653	40	[Bridge]
127	8654	41	The autumn chill that wakes me up
127	8655	42	You loved the amber skies so much
127	8656	43	Long limbs and frozen swims
127	8657	44	You'd always go past where our feet could touch
127	8658	45	And I complained the whole way there
127	8659	46	The car ride back and up the stairs
127	8660	47	I should've asked you questions
127	8661	48	I should've asked you how to be
127	8662	49	Asked you to write it down for me
127	8663	50	Should've kept every grocery store receipt
127	8664	51	'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
127	8665	52	Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
127	8666	53	All your closets of backlogged dreams
127	8667	54	And how you left them all to me
127	8668	55	[Chorus]
127	8669	56	What died didn't stay dead
127	8670	57	What died didn't stay dead
127	8671	58	You're alive, you're alive in my head
127	8672	59	What died didn't stay dead
127	8673	60	What died didn't stay dead
127	8674	61	You're alive, so alive

127	8676	63	[Outro]
127	8677	64	And if I didn't know better
127	8678	65	I'd think you were singing to me now
127	8679	66	If I didn't know better
127	8680	67	I'd think you were still around
127	8681	68	I know better
127	8682	69	But I still feel you all around
127	8683	70	I know better
127	8684	71	But you're still around4
128	7983	1	[Verse 1]
128	7984	2	It's been a long time
128	7985	3	And seeing the shape of your name
128	7986	4	Still spells out pain
128	7987	5	It wasn't right
128	7988	6	The way it all went down
128	7989	7	Looks like you know that now
128	7990	8	
128	7991	9	[Chorus]
128	7992	10	Yes, I got your letter
128	7993	11	Yes, I'm doing better
128	7994	12	It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
128	7995	13	Yes, I got your letter
128	7996	14	Yes, I'm doing better
128	7997	15	I know that it's over, I don't need your
128	7998	16	Closure, your closure
128	7999	17	
128	8000	18	[Verse 2]
128	8001	19	Don't treat me like
128	8002	20	Some situation that needs to be handled
128	8003	21	I'm fine with my spite
128	8004	22	And my tears, and my beers and my candles
128	8005	23	I can feel you smoothing me over
128	8006	24	
128	8007	25	[Chorus]
128	8008	26	Yes, I got your letter
128	8009	27	Yes, I'm doing bettеr
128	8010	28	It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
128	8011	29	Yes, I got your lеtter
128	8012	30	Yes, I'm doing better
128	8013	31	I know that it's over, I don't need your
128	8014	32	Closure, your closure
128	8015	33	Your closure, your closure
128	8016	34	[Bridge]
128	8017	35	I know I'm just a wrinkle in your new life
128	8018	36	Staying friends would iron it out so nice
128	8019	37	Guilty, guilty, reaching out across the sea
128	8020	38	That you put between you and me
128	8021	39	But it's fake and it's oh so unnecessary
128	8022	40	
128	8023	41	[Chorus]
128	8024	42	Yes, I got your letter
128	8025	43	Yes, I'm doing better
128	8026	44	It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
128	8027	45	Yes, I got your letter
128	8028	46	Yes, I'm doing better
128	8029	47	I know that it's over, I don't need your
128	8030	48	Closure, closure, your closure
128	8031	49	Your closure2
129	8242	1	[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
129	8243	2	Gray November
129	8244	3	I've been down since July
129	8245	4	Motion capture
129	8246	5	Put me in a bad light
129	8247	6	I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
129	8248	7	Trying to find the one where I went wrong
129	8249	8	Writing letters
129	8250	9	Addressed to the fire
129	8251	10	
129	8252	11	[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
129	8253	12	And I was catching my breath
129	8254	13	Staring out an open window
129	8255	14	Catching my death
129	8256	15	And I couldn't be sure
129	8257	16	I had a feeling so peculiar
129	8258	17	That this pain would be for
129	8259	18	Evermore
129	8260	19	
129	8261	20	[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
129	8262	21	Hey December
129	8263	22	Guess I'm feeling unmoored
129	8264	23	Can't remember
129	8265	24	What I used to fight for
129	8266	25	I rewind thе tape, but all it does is pause
129	8267	26	On thе very moment all was lost
129	8268	27	Sending signals
129	8269	28	To be double-crossed
129	8270	29	[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
129	8271	30	And I was catching my breath
129	8272	31	Barefoot in the wildest winter
129	8273	32	Catching my death
129	8274	33	And I couldn't be sure
129	8275	34	I had a feeling so peculiar
129	8276	35	That this pain would be for
129	8277	36	Evermore
129	8278	37	(Evermore)
129	8279	38	[Bridge: Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift]
129	8280	39	Can't not think of all the cost
129	8281	40	And the things that will be lost
129	8282	41	Oh, can we just get a pause?
129	8283	42	To be certain, we'll be tall again
129	8284	43	Whether weather be the frost
129	8285	44	Or the violence of the dog days
129	8286	45	I'm on waves, out being tossed
129	8287	46	Is there a line that I could just go cross?
129	8288	47	And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost now)
129	8289	48	I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)
129	8290	49	In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)
129	8291	50	I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again)
129	8292	51	(If you think of all the costs)
129	8293	52	It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)
129	8294	53	To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)
129	8295	54	(Or the violence of the dog days)
129	8296	55	(Out on waves, being tossed)
129	8297	56	(I'm on waves, out being tossed)
129	8298	57	But I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?)
129	8299	58	You were there
129	8300	59	[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
129	8301	60	And I was catching my breath
129	8302	61	Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
129	8303	62	And I couldn't be sure
129	8304	63	I had a feeling so peculiar
129	8305	64	This pain wouldn't be for
129	8306	65	Evermore
129	8307	66	Evermore
129	8308	67	Evermore
129	8309	68	This pain wouldn't be for evermore

197	14677	1	[Verse 1]
197	14678	2	I like the way you sound in the morning
197	14679	3	We're on the phone and without a warning
197	14680	4	I realize your laugh is the best sound
197	14681	5	I have ever heard
197	14682	6	I like the way I can't keep my focus
197	14683	7	I watch you talk, you didn't notice
197	14684	8	I hear the words but all I can think is
197	14685	9	"We should be together"
197	14686	10	
197	14687	11	[Pre-Chorus]
197	14688	12	Every time you smile, I smile

197	14700	24	Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
197	14701	25	You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face, oh
197	14702	26	I've never been so wrapped up, honey
197	14703	27	I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
197	14704	28	I had time to think it oh-over
197	14705	29	And all I can say is, "Come closer"
197	14706	30	Take a deep breath and jump, then fall into me
197	14707	31	
197	14708	32	[Pre-Chorus]

197	14721	45	The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
197	14722	46	I'll catch you, I'll catch you
197	14723	47	When people say things that bring you to your knees
197	14724	48	I'll catch you
197	14725	49	The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
197	14726	50	But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

198	15083	1	[Verse 1]
198	15084	2	Untouchable like a distant diamond sky

199	14546	2	Once upon a time
199	14547	3	I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye

199	14550	6	You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
199	14551	7	Were you just kidding?
199	14552	8	'Cause it seems to me
199	14553	9	This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
199	14554	10	I don't feel welcome anymore
199	14555	11	Baby, what happened? Please tell me
199	14556	12	'Cause one second it was perfect
199	14557	13	Now you're halfway out the door
199	14558	14	[Chorus]
199	14559	15	And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
199	14560	16	And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
199	14561	17	And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
199	14562	18	Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
199	14563	19	It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
199	14564	20	I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
199	14565	21	
199	14566	22	[Verse 2]
199	14567	23	Was I out of line?
199	14568	24	Did I say something way too honest made you run and hide?
199	14569	25	Like a scared little boy
199	14570	26	I looked into your eyes
199	14571	27	Thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure
199	14572	28	So here's to everything coming down to nothing
199	14573	29	Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
199	14574	30	Where is this going?
199	14575	31	Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore
199	14576	32	
199	14577	33	[Chorus]
199	14578	34	And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
199	14579	35	And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
199	14580	36	And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
199	14581	37	And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
199	14582	38	It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
199	14583	39	I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
199	14584	40	[Post-Chorus]
199	14585	41	You didn't mean it, baby
199	14586	42	I don't think so
199	14587	43	
199	14588	44	[Bridge]
199	14589	45	Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
199	14590	46	Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
199	14591	47	Back up, baby, back up
199	14592	48	Did you forget everything?
199	14593	49	Back up, baby, back up
199	14594	50	Did you forget everything?
199	14595	51	Back up, baby, back up
199	14596	52	Please back up, oh back up
199	14597	53	Back up, baby, back up
199	14598	54	
199	14599	55	[Chorus]
199	14600	56	'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
199	14601	57	It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
199	14602	58	I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
199	14603	59	And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
199	14604	60	And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
199	14605	61	And you flashback to when we said, "Forever and always"
199	14606	62	'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
199	14607	63	It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
199	14608	64	I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
199	14609	65	[Outro]
199	14610	66	You didn't mean it baby
199	14611	67	You said, "Forever and always", yeah
200	14321	1	[Verse 1]
200	14322	2	I could go back to every laugh
200	14323	3	But I don't wanna go there anymore
200	14324	4	And I know all the steps up to your door
200	14325	5	But I don't wanna go there anymore
200	14326	6	
200	14327	7	[Pre-Chorus]
200	14328	8	Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
200	14329	9	Talk to the man with the reasons why
200	14330	10	And let me know what you find
200	14331	11	[Chorus]
200	14332	12	I'll leave my window open
200	14333	13	'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
200	14334	14	Just know I'm right here hoping
200	14335	15	That you'll come in with the rain
200	14336	16	
200	14337	17	[Verse 2]
200	14338	18	I could stand up and sing you a song
200	14339	19	But I don't wanna have to go that far
200	14340	20	And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
200	14341	21	And you don't even know where I start
200	14342	22	
200	14343	23	[Pre-Chorus]
200	14344	24	Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
200	14345	25	Talk to the man who put you here
200	14346	26	And don't wait for the sky to clear
200	14347	27	
200	14348	28	[Chorus]
200	14349	29	I'll leave my window open
200	14350	30	'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
200	14351	31	Just know I'm right here hoping
200	14352	32	That you'll come in with the rain
200	14353	33	
200	14354	34	[Bridge]
200	14355	35	I've watched you so long, screamed your name
200	14356	36	I don't know what else I can say
200	14357	37	[Chorus]
200	14358	38	But I'll leave my window open
200	14359	39	'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games
200	14360	40	Just know I'm right here hoping
200	14361	41	That you'll come in with the rain
200	14362	42	
200	14363	43	[Outro]
200	14364	44	I could go back to every laugh
200	14365	45	But I don't wanna go there anymore
201	14813	1	[Verse 1]
201	14814	2	This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
201	14815	3	There ain’t nothing more right babe
201	14816	4	Misty morning comes again and I can't
201	14817	5	Help but wish I could see your face
201	14818	6	And I knew from the first note played
201	14819	7	I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
201	14820	8	You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
201	14821	9	Scream your name
201	14822	10	
201	14823	11	[Chorus]
201	14824	12	So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
201	14825	13	"I can't take my eyes off of you"
201	14826	14	I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
201	14827	15	Who's desperately in love with you
201	14828	16	Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
201	14829	17	[Verse 2]
201	14830	18	Good morning loneliness
201	14831	19	Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
201	14832	20	When my world wakes up today
201	14833	21	You'll be in another town
201	14834	22	And I knew when I saw your face
201	14835	23	I'd be counting down the ways to see you
201	14836	24	You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row Scream your name
201	14837	25	
201	14838	26	[Chorus]
201	14839	27	So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
201	14840	28	"I can't take my eyes off of you"
201	14841	29	I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
201	14842	30	Who's desperately in love with you
201	14843	31	Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
201	14844	32	
201	14845	33	[Bridge]
201	14846	34	You played in bars, you play guitar
201	14847	35	And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
201	14848	36	And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
201	14849	37	Every night from the radio
201	14850	38	
201	14851	39	[Chorus]
201	14852	40	So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
201	14853	41	"I can't take my eyes off of you"
201	14854	42	I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
201	14855	43	Who's desperately in love with you
201	14856	44	Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
201	14857	45	[Outro]
201	14858	46	Sweet, sweet superstar
201	14859	47	Superstar
202	14961	1	[Verse 1]
202	14962	2	In the heat of the fight, I walked away
202	14963	3	Ignoring words that you were saying
202	14964	4	Tryin' to make me stay
202	14965	5	I said, "This time I've had enough"
202	14966	6	And you've called a hundred times
202	14967	7	But I'm not picking up
202	14968	8	
202	14969	9	[Pre-Chorus]
202	14970	10	'Cause I'm so mad
202	14971	11	I might tell you that it's over
202	14972	12	But if you look a little closer
202	14973	13	[Chorus]
202	14974	14	I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
202	14975	15	To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
202	14976	16	Screaming, "I'm in love with you"
202	14977	17	Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
202	14978	18	And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on
202	14979	19	The other side of the door
202	14980	20	
202	14981	21	[Verse 2]
202	14982	22	Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
202	14983	23	Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
202	14984	24	I keep going back over things we both said
202	14985	25	And I remember the slamming door
202	14986	26	And all the things that I misread
202	14987	27	
202	14988	28	[Pre-Chorus]
202	14989	29	So, babe, if you know everything
202	14990	30	Tell me why you couldn't see
202	14991	31	When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah
202	14992	32	
202	14993	33	[Chorus]
202	14994	34	I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
202	14995	35	To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
202	14996	36	Screaming, "I'm in love with you"
202	14997	37	Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
202	14998	38	And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on
202	14999	39	The other side of the door
202	15000	40	[Bridge]
202	15001	41	And I'll scream out the window
202	15002	42	"I can't even look at you"
202	15003	43	"I don't need you," but I do, I do, I do
202	15004	44	I'll say, "There's nothing you can say"
202	15005	45	"To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it"
202	15006	46	What I mean is
202	15007	47	
202	15008	48	[Chorus]
202	15009	49	I said, "Leave," but, baby, all I want is you
202	15010	50	To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
202	15011	51	Screaming, "I'm in love with you"
202	15012	52	Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
202	15013	53	And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on
202	15014	54	The other side of the door
202	15015	55	
202	15016	56	[Outro]
202	15017	57	With your face and the beautiful eyes
202	15018	58	And the conversation with the little white lies
202	15019	59	And the faded picture of a beautiful night
202	15020	60	You carried me from your car up the stairs
202	15021	61	And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
202	15022	62	After everything and that little black dress
202	15023	63	After everything, I must confess, I need you
203	14366	1	[Verse 1]
203	14367	2	There's something 'bout the way
203	14368	3	The street looks when it's just rained
203	14369	4	There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
203	14370	5	And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
203	14371	6	In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
203	14372	7	Oh, yeah
203	14373	8	
203	14374	9	[Verse 2]
203	14375	10	We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
203	14376	11	I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
203	14377	12	But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
203	14378	13	Absentmindedly making me want you
203	14379	14	[Chorus]
203	14380	15	And I don't know how it gets better than this
203	14381	16	You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
203	14382	17	And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance
203	14383	18	In a storm in my best dress, fearless
203	14384	19	
203	14385	20	[Verse 3]
203	14386	21	So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
203	14387	22	In this one horse town, I wanna stay right here
203	14388	23	In this passenger's seat
203	14389	24	You put your eyes on me
203	14390	25	In this moment now, capture it, remember it
203	14391	26	
203	14392	27	[Chorus]
203	14393	28	'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
203	14394	29	You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
203	14395	30	And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance
203	14396	31	In a storm in my best dress, fearless
203	14397	32	
203	14398	33	[Bridge]
203	14399	34	Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
203	14400	35	My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
203	14401	36	You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
203	14402	37	It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
203	14403	38	It's fearless
203	14404	39	Oh, yeah
203	14405	40	[Chorus]
203	14406	41	'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
203	14407	42	You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
203	14408	43	And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance
203	14409	44	In a storm in my best dress, fearless
203	14410	45	'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
203	14411	46	You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
203	14412	47	And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance
203	14413	48	In a storm in my best dress, fearless
203	14414	49	
203	14415	50	[Outro]
203	14416	51	Oh, oh
203	14417	52	Oh, yeah3
204	14418	1	[Verse 1]
204	14419	2	You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
204	14420	3	It's the mornin' of your very first day
204	14421	4	You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
204	14422	5	Try and stay out of everybody's way
204	14423	6	It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
204	14424	7	For the next four years in this town
204	14425	8	Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
204	14426	9	"You know, I haven't seen you around before"
204	14427	10	
204	14428	11	[Chorus]
204	14429	12	'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
204	14430	13	You're gonna believe them
204	14431	14	And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
204	14432	15	Well, count to ten, take it in
204	14433	16	This is life before you know who you're gonna be
204	14434	17	Fifteen
204	14435	18	[Verse 2]
204	14436	19	You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
204	14437	20	And soon enough, you're best friends
204	14438	21	Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
204	14439	22	We'll be outta here as soon as we can
204	14440	23	And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car
204	14441	24	And you're feelin' like flyin'
204	14442	25	And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
204	14443	26	And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
204	14444	27	When the night ends
204	14445	28	
204	14446	29	[Chorus]
204	14447	30	'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
204	14448	31	You're gonna believe them
204	14449	32	And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
204	14450	33	Makes your head spin 'round
204	14451	34	But in your life, you'll do things greater than
204	14452	35	Dating the boy on the football team
204	14453	36	But I didn't know it at fifteen
204	14454	37	
204	14455	38	[Bridge]
204	14456	39	When all you wanted was to be wanted
204	14457	40	Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
204	14458	41	Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
204	14459	42	But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
204	14460	43	And Abigail gave everything she had
204	14461	44	To a boy who changed his mind
204	14462	45	And we both cried
204	14463	46	[Chorus]
204	14464	47	'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
204	14465	48	You're gonna believe them
204	14466	49	And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
204	14467	50	I've found time can heal most anything
204	14468	51	And you just might find who you're supposed to be
204	14469	52	I didn't know who I was supposed to be
204	14470	53	At fifteen
204	14471	54	
204	14472	55	[Post-Chorus]
204	14473	56	La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
204	14474	57	La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
204	14475	58	La-la-la, la-la-la
204	14476	59	
204	14477	60	[Outro]
204	14478	61	Your very first day
204	14479	62	Take a deep breath, girl
204	14480	63	Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors4
205	14746	1	[Verse 1]
205	14747	2	We were both young when I first saw you
205	14748	3	I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
205	14749	4	I'm standing there
205	14750	5	On a balcony in summer air
205	14751	6	See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
205	14752	7	See you make your way through the crowd
205	14753	8	And say, "Hello"
205	14754	9	Little did I know
205	14755	10	
205	14756	11	[Pre-Chorus]
205	14757	12	That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
205	14758	13	And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
205	14759	14	And I was crying on the staircase
205	14760	15	Begging you, "Please, don't go," and I said
205	14761	16	[Chorus]
205	14762	17	Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
205	14763	18	I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
205	14764	19	You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
205	14765	20	It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes"
205	14766	21	
205	14767	22	[Verse 2]
205	14768	23	So I sneak out to the garden to see you
205	14769	24	We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
205	14770	25	So close your eyes
205	14771	26	Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
205	14772	27	
205	14773	28	[Pre-Chorus]
205	14774	29	'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
205	14775	30	And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
205	14776	31	But you were everything to me
205	14777	32	I was begging you, "Please, don't go," and I said
205	14778	33	
205	14779	34	[Chorus]
205	14780	35	Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
205	14781	36	I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
205	14782	37	You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
205	14783	38	It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes"
205	14784	39	Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
205	14785	40	This love is difficult, but it's real
205	14786	41	Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
205	14787	42	It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes"
205	14788	43	[Post-Chorus]
205	14789	44	Oh, oh
205	14790	45	
205	14791	46	[Bridge]
205	14792	47	I got tired of waiting
205	14793	48	Wondering if you were ever coming around
205	14794	49	My faith in you was fading
205	14795	50	When I met you on the outskirts of town
205	14796	51	
205	14797	52	[Breakdown]
205	14798	53	And I said, "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
205	14799	54	I keep waiting for you but you never come
205	14800	55	Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
205	14801	56	He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
205	14802	57	
205	14803	58	[Chorus]
205	14804	59	"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
205	14805	60	I love you, and that's all I really know
205	14806	61	I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
205	14807	62	It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'"
205	14808	63	
205	14809	64	[Outro]
205	14810	65	Oh, oh, oh
205	14811	66	Oh, oh, oh
205	14812	67	'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
206	14612	1	[Intro]
206	14613	2	Mmm-mm, mm-mm
206	14614	3	Mmm-mm, mm-mm
206	14615	4	Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah
206	14616	5	
206	14617	6	[Verse 1]
206	14618	7	Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
206	14619	8	But I know I saw a light in you
206	14620	9	And as we walked, we were talking
206	14621	10	I didn't say half the things I wanted to
206	14622	11	Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
206	14623	12	I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
206	14624	13	Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
206	14625	14	I don't always have to be alone
206	14626	15	[Chorus]
206	14627	16	'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
206	14628	17	Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
206	14629	18	Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
206	14630	19	Can't help it if there's no one else
206	14631	20	Mmm, I can't help myself
206	14632	21	
206	14633	22	[Verse 2]
206	14634	23	Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
206	14635	24	So I got some things to say to you, ha
206	14636	25	I've seen it all, so I thought
206	14637	26	But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
206	14638	27	The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
206	14639	28	It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
206	14640	29	Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving?
206	14641	30	I think you and I should stay the same
206	14642	31	
206	14643	32	[Chorus]
206	14644	33	'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
206	14645	34	Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
206	14646	35	Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
206	14647	36	Can't help it if there's no one else
206	14648	37	Mmm, I can't help myself
206	14649	38	
206	14650	39	[Bridge]
206	14651	40	They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
206	14652	41	Why aren't you here tonight?
206	14653	42	I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
206	14654	43	And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
206	14655	44	[Breakdown]
206	14656	45	Hey, Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
206	14657	46	Why I should be the one you choose
206	14658	47	All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
206	14659	48	But would they write a song for you? (Ha-ha)
206	14660	49	
206	14661	50	[Chorus]
206	14662	51	I can't help it if you look like an angel
206	14663	52	Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
206	14664	53	Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
206	14665	54	Can't help it if there's no one else
206	14666	55	Mmm, I can't help myself
206	14667	56	If you look like an angel
206	14668	57	Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
206	14669	58	Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
206	14670	59	Can't help it if there's no one else
206	14671	60	Mmm, I can't help myself
206	14672	61	
206	14673	62	[Outro]
206	14674	63	Myself
206	14675	64	Can't help myself
206	14676	65	I can't help myself
207	15142	1	[Verse 1]
207	15143	2	Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
207	15144	3	Comes out just when you need it to
207	15145	4	As I paced back and forth all this time
207	15146	5	'Cause I honestly believed in you
207	15147	6	Holdin' on, the days drag on
207	15148	7	Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known
207	15149	8	
207	15150	9	[Chorus]
207	15151	10	That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
207	15152	11	I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
207	15153	12	This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
207	15154	13	I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
207	15155	14	Now it's too late for you and your white horse
207	15156	15	To come around
207	15157	16	[Verse 2]
207	15158	17	Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
207	15159	18	And never really had a chance
207	15160	19	My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
207	15161	20	You had to fight to have the upper hand
207	15162	21	I had so many dreams about you and me
207	15163	22	Happy endings, now I know
207	15164	23	
207	15165	24	[Chorus]
207	15166	25	That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
207	15167	26	I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
207	15168	27	This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
207	15169	28	I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
207	15170	29	Now it's too late for you and your white horse
207	15171	30	To come around
207	15172	31	
207	15173	32	[Bridge]
207	15174	33	And there you are on your knees
207	15175	34	Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
207	15176	35	Just like I always wanted
207	15177	36	But I'm so sorry
207	15178	37	
207	15179	38	[Chorus]
207	15180	39	'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
207	15181	40	I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
207	15182	41	This is a big world, that was a small town
207	15183	42	There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
207	15184	43	And it's too late for you and your white horse
207	15185	44	Now it's too late for you and your white horse
207	15186	45	To catch me now
207	15187	46	[Outro]
207	15188	47	Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
207	15189	48	Try and catch me now, oh
207	15190	49	It's too late to catch me now4
208	15191	1	[Verse 1]
208	15192	2	You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
208	15193	3	She's going off about something that you said
208	15194	4	'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
208	15195	5	I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
208	15196	6	I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
208	15197	7	And she'll never know your story like I do
208	15198	8	
208	15199	9	[Pre-Chorus]
208	15200	10	But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
208	15201	11	She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
208	15202	12	Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
208	15203	13	That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
208	15204	14	[Chorus]
208	15205	15	If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
208	15206	16	Been here all along, so why can't you see?
208	15207	17	You belong with me, you belong with me
208	15208	18	
208	15209	19	[Verse 2]
208	15210	20	Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
208	15211	21	I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
208	15212	22	Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
208	15213	23	Hey, isn't this easy?
208	15214	24	And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
208	15215	25	I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
208	15216	26	You say you're fine, I know you better than that
208	15217	27	Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?
208	15218	28	
208	15219	29	[Pre-Chorus]
208	15220	30	She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
208	15221	31	She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
208	15222	32	Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
208	15223	33	That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
208	15224	34	
208	15225	35	[Chorus]
208	15226	36	If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
208	15227	37	Been here all along, so why can't you see?
208	15228	38	You belong with me
208	15229	39	Standing by and waiting at your back door
208	15230	40	All this time, how could you not know, baby?
208	15231	41	You belong with me, you belong with me
208	15232	42	[Bridge]
208	15233	43	Oh, I remember you driving to my house
208	15234	44	In the middle of the night
208	15235	45	I'm the one who makes you laugh
208	15236	46	When you know you're 'bout to cry
208	15237	47	And I know your favorite songs
208	15238	48	And you tell me 'bout your dreams
208	15239	49	Think I know where you belong
208	15240	50	Think I know it's with me
208	15241	51	
208	15242	52	[Chorus]
208	15243	53	Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
208	15244	54	Been here all along, so why can't you see?
208	15245	55	You belong with me
208	15246	56	Standing by and waiting at your back door
208	15247	57	All this time, how could you not know, baby?
208	15248	58	You belong with me, you belong with me
208	15249	59	
208	15250	60	[Outro]
208	15251	61	You belong with me
208	15252	62	Have you ever thought just maybe
208	15253	63	You belong with me?
208	15254	64	You belong with me
209	14220	1	[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
209	14221	2	I see your face in my mind as I drive away
209	14222	3	'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
209	14223	4	People are people and sometimes, we change our minds
209	14224	5	But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
209	14225	6	
209	14226	7	[Verse 2: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
209	14227	8	Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
209	14228	9	It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
209	14229	10	'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
209	14230	11	Now, I don't know what to be without you around
209	14231	12	[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
209	14232	13	And we know it's never simple, never easy
209	14233	14	Never a clean break, no one here to save me
209	14234	15	You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
209	14235	16	
209	14236	17	[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
209	14237	18	And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
209	14238	19	Breathe without you, but I have to
209	14239	20	
209	14240	21	[Verse 3: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
209	14241	22	Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
209	14242	23	Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
209	14243	24	But people are people and sometimes, it doesn't work out
209	14244	25	Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out
209	14245	26	
209	14246	27	[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
209	14247	28	And we know it's never simple, never easy
209	14248	29	Never a clean break, no one here to save me
209	14249	30	You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
209	14250	31	
209	14251	32	[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
209	14252	33	And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
209	14253	34	Breathe without you but I have to
209	14254	35	
209	14255	36	[Bridge: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
209	14256	37	It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend
209	14257	38	Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
209	14258	39	It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend
209	14259	40	Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me
209	14260	41	[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
209	14261	42	And we know it's never simple, never easy
209	14262	43	Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh-oh
209	14263	44	
209	14264	45	[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
209	14265	46	I can't breathe without you, but I have to
209	14266	47	Breathe without you, but I have to
209	14267	48	Breathe without you, but I have to
209	14268	49	
209	14269	50	[Outro: Taylor Swift & Colbie Caillat]
209	14270	51	I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Mmm)
209	14271	52	I'm sorry, (Yeah, yeah) I'm sorry
209	14272	53	I'm sorry, I'm sorry
209	14273	54	I'm sorry1
210	14860	1	[Verse 1]
210	14861	2	I took a chance, I took a shot
210	14862	3	And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
210	14863	4	You took a swing, I took it hard
210	14864	5	And down here from the ground, I see who you are
210	14865	6	
210	14866	7	[Chorus]
210	14867	8	I'm sick and tired of your attitude
210	14868	9	I'm feeling like I don't know you
210	14869	10	You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
210	14870	11	And I need you like a heartbeat
210	14871	12	But you know you got a mean streak
210	14872	13	That makes me run for cover when you're around
210	14873	14	And here's to you and your temper
210	14874	15	Yes, I remember what you said last night
210	14875	16	And I know that you see what you're doing to me
210	14876	17	Tell me why
210	14877	18	[Verse 2]
210	14878	19	You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
210	14879	20	Well, I get so confused and frustrated
210	14880	21	Forget what I'm trying to say, oh
210	14881	22	
210	14882	23	[Chorus]
210	14883	24	I'm sick and tired of your reasons
210	14884	25	I got no one to believe in
210	14885	26	You tell me that you want me, then push me around
210	14886	27	And I need you like a heartbeat
210	14887	28	But you know you got a mean streak
210	14888	29	That makes me run for cover when you're around
210	14889	30	Here's to you and your temper
210	14890	31	Yes, I remember what you said last night
210	14891	32	And I know that you see what you're doing to me
210	14892	33	Tell me why
210	14893	34	
210	14894	35	[Bridge]
210	14895	36	Why do you have to make me feel small
210	14896	37	So you can feel whole inside?
210	14897	38	Why do you have to put down my dreams
210	14898	39	So you're the only thing on my mind?
210	14899	40	
210	14900	41	[Chorus]
210	14901	42	I'm sick and tired of your attitude
210	14902	43	I'm feeling like I don't know you
210	14903	44	You tell me that you want me, then cut me down
210	14904	45	I'm sick and tired of your reasons
210	14905	46	I've got no one to believe in
210	14906	47	You ask me for my love, then you push me around
210	14907	48	Here's to you and your temper
210	14908	49	Yes, I remember what you said last night
210	14909	50	And I know that you see what you're doing to me
210	14910	51	Tell me why (Why)
210	14911	52	Tell me why (Why)
210	14912	53	[Outro]
210	14913	54	I take a step back, let you go
210	14914	55	I told you I'm not bulletproof
210	14915	56	Now you know
211	15255	1	[Verse 1]
211	15256	2	All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
211	15257	3	I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
211	15258	4	And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
211	15259	5	And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around
211	15260	6	
211	15261	7	[Chorus]
211	15262	8	You don't have to call anymore
211	15263	9	I won't pick up the phone
211	15264	10	This is the last straw
211	15265	11	Don't wanna hurt anymore
211	15266	12	And you can tell me that you're sorry
211	15267	13	But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
211	15268	14	You're not sorry (No, no, no, no)
211	15269	15	[Verse 2]
211	15270	16	You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
211	15271	17	Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
211	15272	18	And you've got your share of secrets
211	15273	19	And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
211	15274	20	And now you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before
211	15275	21	
211	15276	22	[Chorus]
211	15277	23	But you don't have to call anymore
211	15278	24	I won't pick up the phone
211	15279	25	This is the last straw
211	15280	26	Don't wanna hurt anymore
211	15281	27	And you can tell me that you're sorry
211	15282	28	But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
211	15283	29	You're not sorry (No, no, no, no)
211	15284	30	You're not sorry (No, no, no, no)
211	15285	31	
211	15286	32	[Bridge]
211	15287	33	You had me crawling for you, honey, and it never would've gone away, no
211	15288	34	You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade
211	15289	35	
211	15290	36	[Chorus]
211	15291	37	So you don't have to call anymore
211	15292	38	I won't pick up the phone
211	15293	39	This is the last straw
211	15294	40	There's nothing left to beg for
211	15295	41	And you can tell me that you're sorry
211	15296	42	But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
211	15297	43	You're not sorry (No, no, no, no)
211	15298	44	You're not sorry (No, no, no, no)
211	15299	45	(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
211	15300	46	Woah, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
211	15301	47	(Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no)
212	15024	1	[Verse 1]
212	15025	2	He is sensible and so incredible
212	15026	3	And all my single friends are jealous
212	15027	4	He says everything I need to hear and it's like
212	15028	5	I couldn't ask for anything better
212	15029	6	He opens up my door and I get into his car
212	15030	7	And he says you look beautiful tonight
212	15031	8	And I feel perfectly fine
212	15032	9	
212	15033	10	[Chorus]
212	15034	11	But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
212	15035	12	And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
212	15036	13	You're so in love that you act insane
212	15037	14	And that's the way I loved you
212	15038	15	Breaking down and coming undone
212	15039	16	It's a roller coaster kind of rush
212	15040	17	And I never knew I could feel that much
212	15041	18	And that's the way I loved you
212	15042	19	[Verse 2]
212	15043	20	He respects my space
212	15044	21	And never makes me wait
212	15045	22	And he calls exactly when he says he will
212	15046	23	He's close to my mother
212	15047	24	Talks business with my father
212	15048	25	He's charming and endearing
212	15049	26	And I'm comfortable
212	15050	27	
212	15051	28	[Chorus]
212	15052	29	But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
212	15053	30	It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
212	15054	31	You're so in love that you acted insane
212	15055	32	And that's the way I loved you
212	15056	33	Breaking down and coming undone
212	15057	34	It's a roller coaster kind of rush
212	15058	35	And I never knew I could feel that much
212	15059	36	And that's the way I loved you
212	15060	37	
212	15061	38	[Bridge]
212	15062	39	He can't see the smile I'm faking
212	15063	40	And my heart's not breaking
212	15064	41	'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
212	15065	42	And you were wild and crazy
212	15066	43	Just so frustrating
212	15067	44	Intoxicating, complicated
212	15068	45	Got away by some mistake and now
212	15069	46	[Chorus]
212	15070	47	I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
212	15071	48	It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
212	15072	49	I'm so in love that I acted insane
212	15073	50	And that's the way I loved you
212	15074	51	Breaking down and coming undone
212	15075	52	It's a roller coaster kind of rush
212	15076	53	And I never knew I could feel that much
212	15077	54	And that's the way I loved you, oh, oh
212	15078	55	
212	15079	56	[Outro]
212	15080	57	And that's the way I loved you, oh, oh
212	15081	58	Never knew I could feel that much
212	15082	59	And that's the way I loved you
213	14481	1	[Verse 1]
213	14482	2	Once upon a time
213	14483	3	I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
213	14484	4	And we caught onto something
213	14485	5	I hold onto the night
213	14486	6	You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
213	14487	7	Were you just kidding?
213	14488	8	'Cause it seems to me
213	14489	9	This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
213	14490	10	I don't feel welcome anymore
213	14491	11	Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
213	14492	12	'Cause one second, it was perfect
213	14493	13	Now you're halfway out the door
213	14494	14	[Chorus]
213	14495	15	And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
213	14496	16	And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
213	14497	17	And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
213	14498	18	Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
213	14499	19	Everything is wrong
213	14500	20	It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
213	14501	21	'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
213	14502	22	
213	14503	23	[Verse 2]
213	14504	24	Was I out of line?
213	14505	25	Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
213	14506	26	Like a scared little boy?
213	14507	27	I looked into your eyes
213	14508	28	Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
213	14509	29	So here's to everything coming down to nothing
213	14510	30	Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
213	14511	31	Where is this going?
213	14512	32	Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore
213	14513	33	
213	14514	34	[Chorus]
213	14515	35	And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
213	14516	36	And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
213	14517	37	And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
213	14518	38	Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
213	14519	39	Everything is wrong
213	14520	40	It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
213	14521	41	'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
213	14522	42	You didn't mean it, baby, I don't think so
213	14523	43	[Bridge]
213	14524	44	Oh, back up, baby, back up
213	14525	45	Did you forget everything?
213	14526	46	Back up, baby, back up
213	14527	47	Did you forget everything?
213	14528	48	
213	14529	49	[Chorus]
213	14530	50	'Cause it rains in your bedroom
213	14531	51	Everything is wrong
213	14532	52	It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
213	14533	53	'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
213	14534	54	Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
213	14535	55	And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
213	14536	56	And you flashback to when we said, "Forever and always"
213	14537	57	And it rains in your bedroom
213	14538	58	Everything is wrong
213	14539	59	It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
213	14540	60	'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
213	14541	61	
213	14542	62	[Outro]
213	14543	63	You didn't mean it, baby
213	14544	64	You said, "Forever and always", yeah
214	14916	1	[Verse 1]
214	14917	2	I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
214	14918	3	I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
214	14919	4	Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
214	14920	5	Look now, the sky is gold
214	14921	6	I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
214	14922	7	
214	14923	8	[Chorus]
214	14924	9	I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
214	14925	10	But I know you're not scared of anything at all
214	14926	11	Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
214	14927	12	But I know I had the best day with you today
214	14928	13	[Verse 2]
214	14929	14	I'm thirteen now
214	14930	15	And don't know how my friends could be so mean
214	14931	16	I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
214	14932	17	And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
214	14933	18	And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names
214	14934	19	
214	14935	20	[Chorus]
214	14936	21	I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
214	14937	22	But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
214	14938	23	Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
214	14939	24	But I know I had the best day with you today
214	14940	25	
214	14941	26	[Bridge]
214	14942	27	I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
214	14943	28	God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
214	14944	29	He's better than I am
214	14945	30	I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
214	14946	31	And I had the best days with you
214	14947	32	
214	14948	33	[Verse 3]
214	14949	34	There is a video I found from back when I was three
214	14950	35	You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
214	14951	36	It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
214	14952	37	And Daddy's smart
214	14953	38	And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
214	14954	39	[Chorus]
214	14955	40	And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
214	14956	41	I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
214	14957	42	And I love you for giving me your eyes
214	14958	43	For staying back and watching me shine
214	14959	44	And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say
214	14960	45	That I had the best day with you today
215	14274	1	[Verse 1]
215	14275	2	And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
215	14276	3	Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
215	14277	4	You know it's all the same, another time and place
215	14278	5	Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
215	14279	6	But I believe in whatever you do
215	14280	7	And I'll do anything to see it through
215	14281	8	
215	14282	9	[Chorus]
215	14283	10	Because these things will change
215	14284	11	Can you feel it now?
215	14285	12	These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
215	14286	13	This revolution, the time will come
215	14287	14	For us to finally win
215	14288	15	And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
215	14289	16	Oh, oh
215	14290	17	[Verse 2]
215	14291	18	So, we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered
215	14292	19	It's hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
215	14293	20	We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
215	14294	21	They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
215	14295	22	You can walk away, say we don't need this
215	14296	23	But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this
215	14297	24	
215	14298	25	[Chorus]
215	14299	26	'Cause these things will change
215	14300	27	Can you feel it now?
215	14301	28	These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
215	14302	29	This revolution, the time will come
215	14303	30	For us to finally win
215	14304	31	And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
215	14305	32	Oh, oh
215	14306	33	
215	14307	34	[Bridge]
215	14308	35	Tonight, we stand, get off our knees
215	14309	36	Fight for what we've worked for all these years
215	14310	37	And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
215	14311	38	But we'll stand up champions tonight
215	14312	39	
215	14313	40	[Chorus]
215	14314	41	It was the night things changed
215	14315	42	Can you see it now?
215	14316	43	These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
215	14317	44	It's a revolution, throw your hands up
215	14318	45	'Cause we never gave in
215	14319	46	And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
215	14320	47	Hallelujah2
216	15557	1	[Verse 1]
216	15558	2	There's something 'bout the way
216	15559	3	The street looks when it's just rained
216	15560	4	There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
216	15561	5	And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
216	15562	6	In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
216	15563	7	Oh, yeah
216	15564	8	
216	15565	9	[Verse 2]
216	15566	10	We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
216	15567	11	I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
216	15568	12	But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
216	15569	13	Absent-mindedly making me want you
216	15570	14	[Chorus]
216	15571	15	And I don't know how it gets better than this
216	15572	16	You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
216	15573	17	And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
216	15574	18	In a storm in my best dress, fеarless
216	15575	19	
216	15576	20	[Verse 3]
216	15577	21	So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this onе-horse town
216	15578	22	I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
216	15579	23	You put your eyes on me
216	15580	24	In this moment now, capture it, remember it
216	15581	25	
216	15582	26	[Chorus]
216	15583	27	'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
216	15584	28	You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
216	15585	29	And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
216	15586	30	In a storm in my best dress, fearless
216	15587	31	Oh, oh
216	15588	32	
216	15589	33	[Bridge]
216	15590	34	Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
216	15591	35	My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
216	15592	36	You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
216	15593	37	It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
216	15594	38	It's fearless
216	15595	39	Oh, yeah
216	15596	40	[Chorus]
216	15597	41	'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
216	15598	42	You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
216	15599	43	And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
216	15600	44	In a storm in my best dress, fearless
216	15601	45	'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
216	15602	46	You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
216	15603	47	And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
216	15604	48	In a storm in my best dress, fearless

216	15608	52	Oh-oh, yeah2
217	15609	1	[Verse 1]
217	15610	2	You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
217	15611	3	It's the mornin' of your very first day
217	15612	4	You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
217	15613	5	Try and stay out of everybody's way
217	15614	6	It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
217	15615	7	For the next four years in this town
217	15616	8	Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
217	15617	9	"You know, I haven't seen you around before"
217	15618	10	
217	15619	11	[Chorus]
217	15620	12	'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
217	15621	13	You're gonna believe them
217	15622	14	And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
217	15623	15	Well, count to ten, take it in
217	15624	16	This is life before you know who you're gonna be
217	15625	17	At fifteen
217	15626	18	[Verse 2]
217	15627	19	You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
217	15628	20	And soon enough, you're best friends
217	15629	21	Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
217	15630	22	We'll be outta here as soon as we can
217	15631	23	And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
217	15632	24	And you're feelin' like flyin'
217	15633	25	And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
217	15634	26	And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
217	15635	27	When the night ends
217	15636	28	
217	15637	29	[Chorus]
217	15638	30	'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
217	15639	31	You're gonna believe them
217	15640	32	And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
217	15641	33	Makes your head spin around, well
217	15642	34	In your life you'll do things greater than
217	15643	35	Datin' the boy on the football team
217	15644	36	I didn't know it at fifteen
217	15645	37	
217	15646	38	[Bridge]
217	15647	39	When all you wanted was to be wanted
217	15648	40	Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
217	15649	41	Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
217	15650	42	But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
217	15651	43	And Abigail gave everything she had
217	15652	44	To a boy who changed his mind
217	15653	45	And we both cried
217	15654	46	[Chorus]
217	15655	47	'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
217	15656	48	You're gonna believe them
217	15657	49	And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
217	15658	50	But I've found time can heal most anything
217	15659	51	And you just might find who you're supposed to be
217	15660	52	I didn't know who I was supposed to be
217	15661	53	At fifteen
217	15662	54	
217	15663	55	[Post-Chorus]
217	15664	56	La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
217	15665	57	La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
217	15666	58	La-la-la, la-la-la
217	15667	59	
217	15668	60	[Outro]
217	15669	61	Your very first day
217	15670	62	Take a deep breath, girl
217	15671	63	Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
218	15933	1	[Verse 1]
218	15934	2	We were both young when I first saw you
218	15935	3	I close my eyes and the flashback starts
218	15936	4	I'm standing there
218	15937	5	On a balcony in summer air
218	15938	6	See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
218	15939	7	See you make your way through the crowd
218	15940	8	And say, "Hello"
218	15941	9	Little did I know
218	15942	10	
218	15943	11	[Pre-Chorus]
218	15944	12	That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
218	15945	13	And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
218	15946	14	And I was crying on the staircase
218	15947	15	Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
218	15948	16	[Chorus]
218	15949	17	Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
218	15950	18	I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
218	15951	19	You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
218	15952	20	It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
218	15953	21	
218	15954	22	[Verse 2]
218	15955	23	So I sneak out to the garden to see you
218	15956	24	We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
218	15957	25	So close your eyes
218	15958	26	Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
218	15959	27	
218	15960	28	[Pre-Chorus]
218	15961	29	'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
218	15962	30	And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
218	15963	31	But you were everything to me
218	15964	32	I was begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
218	15965	33	
218	15966	34	[Chorus]
218	15967	35	Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
218	15968	36	I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
218	15969	37	You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
218	15970	38	It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
218	15971	39	Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
218	15972	40	This love is difficult, but it's real
218	15973	41	Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
218	15974	42	It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
218	15975	43	[Post-Chorus]
218	15976	44	Oh, oh
218	15977	45	
218	15978	46	[Bridge]
218	15979	47	And I got tired of waiting
218	15980	48	Wondering if you were ever coming around
218	15981	49	My faith in you was fading
218	15982	50	When I met you on the outskirts of town
218	15983	51	
218	15984	52	[Chorus]
218	15985	53	And I said, "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
218	15986	54	I keep waiting for you, but you never come
218	15987	55	Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
218	15988	56	He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
218	15989	57	"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
218	15990	58	I love you and that's all I really know
218	15991	59	I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
218	15992	60	It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"
218	15993	61	
218	15994	62	[Outro]
218	15995	63	Oh, oh, oh
218	15996	64	Oh, oh, oh
218	15997	65	'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
219	15797	1	[Intro]
219	15798	2	Mmm-mm, mm-mm
219	15799	3	Mmm-mm, mm-mm
219	15800	4	Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah
219	15801	5	
219	15802	6	[Verse 1]
219	15803	7	Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
219	15804	8	But I know I saw a light in you
219	15805	9	And as we walked we were talking
219	15806	10	I didn't say half the things I wanted to
219	15807	11	Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
219	15808	12	I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
219	15809	13	Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
219	15810	14	I don't always have to be alone
219	15811	15	[Chorus]
219	15812	16	'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
219	15813	17	Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
219	15814	18	Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
219	15815	19	Can't help it if there's no one else
219	15816	20	Mmm, I can't help myself
219	15817	21	
219	15818	22	[Verse 2]
219	15819	23	Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
219	15820	24	So I've got some things to say to you (Huh)
219	15821	25	I've seen it all, so I thought
219	15822	26	But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
219	15823	27	The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
219	15824	28	It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
219	15825	29	Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?
219	15826	30	I think you and I should stay the same
219	15827	31	
219	15828	32	[Chorus]
219	15829	33	'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
219	15830	34	Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
219	15831	35	Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
219	15832	36	Can't help it if there's no one else
219	15833	37	Mmm, I can't help myself
219	15834	38	
219	15835	39	[Bridge]
219	15836	40	They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
219	15837	41	Why aren't you here tonight?
219	15838	42	I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
219	15839	43	And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
219	15840	44	Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
219	15841	45	Why I should be the one you choose
219	15842	46	All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
219	15843	47	But would they write a song for you? (Ha-ha-ha)
219	15844	48	[Chorus]
219	15845	49	I can't help it if you look like an angel
219	15846	50	Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
219	15847	51	Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
219	15848	52	Can't help it if there's no one else
219	15849	53	Mmm, I can't help myself
219	15850	54	If you look like an angel
219	15851	55	Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
219	15852	56	Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
219	15853	57	Can't help it if there's no one else
219	15854	58	Mmm, I can't help myself
219	15855	59	
219	15856	60	[Outro]
219	15857	61	Ah-uh, myself
219	15858	62	Mmm-mm, I can't help myself
219	15859	63	I can't help myself
219	15860	64	Oh-oh-oh
219	15861	65	Mmm-mm, mm-mm
219	15862	66	Mmm-mm, mm-mm
219	15863	67	Mmm-mm, mm-mm1
220	16650	1	[Verse 1]
220	16651	2	Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
220	16652	3	Comes out just when you need it to
220	16653	4	As I paced back and forth all this time
220	16654	5	'Cause I honestly believed in you
220	16655	6	
220	16656	7	[Pre-Chorus]
220	16657	8	Holdin' on, the days drag on
220	16658	9	Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known
220	16659	10	
220	16660	11	[Chorus]
220	16661	12	That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
220	16662	13	I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
220	16663	14	This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
220	16664	15	I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
220	16665	16	Now it's too late for you and your white horse
220	16666	17	To come around
220	16667	18	[Verse 2]
220	16668	19	Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
220	16669	20	And never really had a chance
220	16670	21	Well, my mistakе, I didn't know to be in love
220	16671	22	You had to fight to have thе upper hand
220	16672	23	
220	16673	24	[Pre-Chorus]
220	16674	25	I had so many dreams about you and me
220	16675	26	Happy endings, well now I know
220	16676	27	
220	16677	28	[Chorus]
220	16678	29	That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
220	16679	30	I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
220	16680	31	This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
220	16681	32	I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
220	16682	33	Now it's too late for you and your white horse
220	16683	34	To come around
220	16684	35	
220	16685	36	[Bridge]
220	16686	37	And there you are on your knees
220	16687	38	Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
220	16688	39	Just like I always wanted
220	16689	40	But I'm so sorry
220	16690	41	
220	16691	42	[Chorus]
220	16692	43	'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
220	16693	44	I'm gonna find someone someday
220	16694	45	Who might actually treat me well
220	16695	46	This is a big world, that was a small town
220	16696	47	There in my rearview mirror disappearing now
220	16697	48	And it's too late for you and your white horse
220	16698	49	Now it's too late for you and your white horse
220	16699	50	To catch me now
220	16700	51	[Outro]
220	16701	52	Oh, woah, woah, woah
220	16702	53	Try and catch me now, oh
220	16703	54	It's too late to catch me now
221	16753	1	[Verse 1]
221	16754	2	You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
221	16755	3	She's going off about something that you said
221	16756	4	'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
221	16757	5	I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
221	16758	6	I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
221	16759	7	And she'll never know your story like I do
221	16760	8	
221	16761	9	[Pre-Chorus]
221	16762	10	'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
221	16763	11	She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
221	16764	12	Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
221	16765	13	That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
221	16766	14	[Chorus]
221	16767	15	If you could see that I'm the onе who understands you
221	16768	16	Been here all along, so why can't you see?
221	16769	17	You bеlong with me, you belong with me
221	16770	18	
221	16771	19	[Verse 2]
221	16772	20	Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
221	16773	21	I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
221	16774	22	Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
221	16775	23	Hey, isn't this easy?
221	16776	24	And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
221	16777	25	I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
221	16778	26	You say you're fine, I know you better than that
221	16779	27	Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?
221	16780	28	
221	16781	29	[Pre-Chorus]
221	16782	30	She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
221	16783	31	She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
221	16784	32	Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
221	16785	33	That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
221	16786	34	
221	16787	35	[Chorus]
221	16788	36	If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
221	16789	37	Been here all along, so why can't you see?
221	16790	38	You belong with me
221	16791	39	Standing by and waiting at your back door
221	16792	40	All this time how could you not know, baby?
221	16793	41	You belong with me, you belong with me
221	16794	42	[Bridge]
221	16795	43	Oh, I remember you driving to my house
221	16796	44	In the middle of the night
221	16797	45	I'm the one who makes you laugh
221	16798	46	When you know you're 'bout to cry
221	16799	47	I know your favorite songs
221	16800	48	And you tell me 'bout your dreams
221	16801	49	Think I know where you belong
221	16802	50	Think I know it's with me
221	16803	51	
221	16804	52	[Chorus]
221	16805	53	Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
221	16806	54	Been here all along, so why can't you see?
221	16807	55	You belong with me
221	16808	56	Standing by and waiting at your back door
221	16809	57	All this time how could you not know, baby?
221	16810	58	You belong with me, you belong with me
221	16811	59	
221	16812	60	[Outro]
221	16813	61	You belong with me
221	16814	62	Have you ever thought just maybe
221	16815	63	You belong with me?
221	16816	64	You belong with me
222	15302	1	[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
222	15303	2	I see your face in my mind as I drive away
222	15304	3	'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
222	15305	4	People are people and sometimes we change our minds
222	15306	5	But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
222	15307	6	
222	15308	7	[Break: Taylor Swift]
222	15309	8	Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
222	15310	9	Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
222	15311	10	
222	15312	11	[Verse 2: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
222	15313	12	The music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
222	15314	13	It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
222	15315	14	'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
222	15316	15	Now I don't know what to be without you around
222	15317	16	[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
222	15318	17	And we know it's never simple, never easy
222	15319	18	Never a clean break, no one here to save me
222	15320	19	You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
222	15321	20	
222	15322	21	[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
222	15323	22	And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
222	15324	23	Breathe without you, but I have to
222	15325	24	
222	15326	25	[Verse 3: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
222	15327	26	Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
222	15328	27	Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
222	15329	28	But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
222	15330	29	And nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout
222	15331	30	
222	15332	31	[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
222	15333	32	And we know it's never simple, never easy
222	15334	33	Never a clean break, no one here to save me
222	15335	34	You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
222	15336	35	
222	15337	36	[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
222	15338	37	And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
222	15339	38	Breathe without you but I have to
222	15340	39	
222	15341	40	[Bridge: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
222	15342	41	It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend
222	15343	42	Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
222	15344	43	It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend
222	15345	44	Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me
222	15346	45	[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
222	15347	46	And we know it's never simple, never easy
222	15348	47	Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh
222	15349	48	
222	15350	49	[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
222	15351	50	I can't breathe without you, but I have to
222	15352	51	Breathe without you, but I have to
222	15353	52	Breathe without you, but I have to
222	15354	53	Breathe without you, but I have to
222	15355	54	
222	15356	55	[Outro: Taylor Swift & Colbie Caillat]
222	15357	56	I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Mmm)
222	15358	57	I'm sorry, (Yeah, yeah) I'm sorry
222	15359	58	I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Ooh, ooh)
222	15360	59	I'm sorry1
223	16187	1	[Verse 1]
223	16188	2	I took a chance, I took a shot
223	16189	3	And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
223	16190	4	You took a swing, I took it hard
223	16191	5	And down here from the ground, I see who you are
223	16192	6	
223	16193	7	[Chorus]
223	16194	8	I'm sick and tired of your attitude
223	16195	9	I'm feeling like I don't know you
223	16196	10	You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
223	16197	11	And I need you like a heartbeat
223	16198	12	But you know you got a mean streak
223	16199	13	Makes me run for cover when you're around
223	16200	14	Here's to you and your temper
223	16201	15	Yes, I remember what you said last night
223	16202	16	And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
223	16203	17	Tell me why
223	16204	18	[Verse 2]
223	16205	19	Well, you could write a book on
223	16206	20	How to ruin someone's perfеct day
223	16207	21	Well, I get so confused and frustratеd
223	16208	22	Forget what I'm tryin' to say, oh
223	16209	23	
223	16210	24	[Chorus]
223	16211	25	I'm sick and tired of your reasons
223	16212	26	I got no one to believe in
223	16213	27	You tell me that you want me, then push me around
223	16214	28	And I need you like a heartbeat
223	16215	29	But you know you got a mean streak
223	16216	30	Makes me run for cover when you're around
223	16217	31	Here's to you and your temper
223	16218	32	Yes, I remember what you said last night
223	16219	33	And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
223	16220	34	Tell me why
223	16221	35	
223	16222	36	[Bridge]
223	16223	37	Why do you have to make me feel small
223	16224	38	So you can feel whole inside?
223	16225	39	Why do you have to put down my dreams
223	16226	40	So you're the only thing on my mind?
223	16227	41	
223	16228	42	[Chorus]
223	16229	43	Well, I'm sick and tired of your attitude
223	16230	44	Feeling like I don't know you
223	16231	45	You tell me that you want me and cut me down
223	16232	46	I'm sick and tired of your reasons
223	16233	47	I've got no one to believe in
223	16234	48	You ask me for my love, then you push me around
223	16235	49	Here's to you and your temper
223	16236	50	Yes, I remember what you said last night
223	16237	51	And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
223	16238	52	Tell me why, why
223	16239	53	Tell me why, oh
223	16240	54	[Outro]
223	16241	55	I take a step back, I let you go
223	16242	56	I told you I'm not bulletproof
223	16243	57	Now you know1
224	16817	1	[Verse 1]
224	16818	2	All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
224	16819	3	I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
224	16820	4	And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
224	16821	5	And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around
224	16822	6	
224	16823	7	[Chorus]
224	16824	8	You don't have to call anymore
224	16825	9	I won't pick up the phone
224	16826	10	This is the last straw
224	16827	11	Don't wanna hurt anymore
224	16828	12	And you can tell me that you're sorry
224	16829	13	But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
224	16830	14	You're not sorry
224	16831	15	No, no, oh-oh
224	16832	16	[Verse 2]
224	16833	17	You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
224	16834	18	Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't lеft me waiting in the cold
224	16835	19	And you've got your sharе of secrets
224	16836	20	And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
224	16837	21	And now you're asking me to listen
224	16838	22	'Cause it's worked each time before
224	16839	23	
224	16840	24	[Chorus]
224	16841	25	But you don't have to call anymore
224	16842	26	I won't pick up the phone
224	16843	27	This is the last straw
224	16844	28	Don't wanna hurt anymore
224	16845	29	And you can tell me that you're sorry
224	16846	30	But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
224	16847	31	You're not sorry
224	16848	32	No, no, oh-oh
224	16849	33	You're not sorry
224	16850	34	No, no, oh-oh
224	16851	35	
224	16852	36	[Bridge]
224	16853	37	You had me crawling for you, honey
224	16854	38	And it never would've gone away, no
224	16855	39	You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade
224	16856	40	
224	16857	41	[Chorus]
224	16858	42	So you don't have to call anymore
224	16859	43	I won't pick up the phone
224	16860	44	This is the last straw
224	16861	45	There's nothing left to beg for
224	16862	46	And you can tell me that you're sorry
224	16863	47	But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
224	16864	48	You're not sorry
224	16865	49	No, no, oh-oh
224	16866	50	You're not sorry
224	16867	51	No, no, oh-oh
224	16868	52	[Outro]
224	16869	53	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
224	16870	54	Woah, oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
224	16871	55	Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no1
225	16412	1	[Verse 1]
225	16413	2	He is sensible and so incredible
225	16414	3	And all my single friends are jealous
225	16415	4	He says everything I need to hear
225	16416	5	And it's like I couldn't ask for anything better
225	16417	6	He opens up my door, and I get into his car
225	16418	7	And he says, "You look beautiful tonight"
225	16419	8	And I feel perfectly fine
225	16420	9	
225	16421	10	[Chorus]
225	16422	11	But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
225	16423	12	And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
225	16424	13	You're so in love that you act insane
225	16425	14	And that's the way I loved you
225	16426	15	Breaking down and coming undone
225	16427	16	It's a rollercoaster kind of rush
225	16428	17	And I never knew I could feel that much
225	16429	18	And that's the way I loved you
225	16430	19	[Verse 2]
225	16431	20	He respects my space
225	16432	21	And never makes me wait
225	16433	22	And he calls exactly when he says he will
225	16434	23	He's close to my mother
225	16435	24	Talks business with my father
225	16436	25	He's charming and endearing
225	16437	26	And I'm comfortable
225	16438	27	
225	16439	28	[Chorus]
225	16440	29	But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
225	16441	30	And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
225	16442	31	You're so in love that you act insane
225	16443	32	And that's the way I loved you
225	16444	33	Breaking down and coming undone
225	16445	34	It's a rollercoaster kind of rush
225	16446	35	And I never knew I could feel that much
225	16447	36	And that's the way I loved you
225	16448	37	
225	16449	38	[Bridge]
225	16450	39	He can't see the smile I'm faking
225	16451	40	And my heart's not breaking
225	16452	41	'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
225	16453	42	And you were wild and crazy
225	16454	43	Just so frustrating
225	16455	44	Intoxicating, complicated
225	16456	45	Got away by some mistake, and now
225	16457	46	[Chorus]
225	16458	47	I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
225	16459	48	It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
225	16460	49	So in love that I acted insane
225	16461	50	And that's the way I loved you
225	16462	51	Breaking down and coming undone
225	16463	52	It's a rollercoaster kind of rush
225	16464	53	And I never knew I could feel that much
225	16465	54	And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
225	16466	55	
225	16467	56	[Outro]
225	16468	57	Woah, woah, oh-oh, oh
225	16469	58	And that's the way I loved you, oh, oh, oh, oh
225	16470	59	Oh, oh, oh, woah
225	16471	60	Never knew I could feel that much
225	16472	61	And that's the way I loved you1
226	15737	1	[Verse 1]
226	15738	2	Once upon a time
226	15739	3	I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
226	15740	4	And we caught onto something
226	15741	5	I hold onto the night
226	15742	6	You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
226	15743	7	Were you just kidding?
226	15744	8	'Cause it seems to me
226	15745	9	This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
226	15746	10	I don't feel welcome anymore
226	15747	11	Baby, what happened? Please tell me
226	15748	12	'Cause one second it was perfect
226	15749	13	Now you're halfway out the door
226	15750	14	[Chorus]
226	15751	15	And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
226	15752	16	And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
226	15753	17	And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
226	15754	18	Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
226	15755	19	It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
226	15756	20	'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
226	15757	21	
226	15758	22	[Verse 2]
226	15759	23	Was I out of line?
226	15760	24	Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
226	15761	25	Like a scared little boy?
226	15762	26	I looked into your eyes
226	15763	27	Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
226	15764	28	So here's to everything coming down to nothing
226	15765	29	Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
226	15766	30	Where is this going?
226	15767	31	Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore
226	15768	32	
226	15769	33	[Chorus]
226	15770	34	And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
226	15771	35	And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
226	15772	36	And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
226	15773	37	Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
226	15774	38	It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
226	15775	39	'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
226	15776	40	You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so
226	15777	41	[Bridge]
226	15778	42	Oh, back up, baby, back up
226	15779	43	Did you forget everything?
226	15780	44	Back up, baby, back up
226	15781	45	Did you forget everything?
226	15782	46	
226	15783	47	[Chorus]
226	15784	48	'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
226	15785	49	It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
226	15786	50	'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
226	15787	51	Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
226	15788	52	And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
226	15789	53	And you flashback to when we said, "Forever and always"
226	15790	54	And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
226	15791	55	It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
226	15792	56	'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
226	15793	57	
226	15794	58	[Outro]
226	15795	59	You didn't mean it baby
226	15796	60	You said, "Forever and always," yeah
227	16305	1	[Verse 1]
227	16306	2	I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
227	16307	3	I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
227	16308	4	Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
227	16309	5	Look now, the sky is gold
227	16310	6	I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
227	16311	7	
227	16312	8	[Chorus]
227	16313	9	I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
227	16314	10	But I know you're not scared of anything at all
227	16315	11	Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
227	16316	12	But I know I had the best day with you today
227	16317	13	[Verse 2]
227	16318	14	I'm thirteen now and don't know how my friends could be so mean
227	16319	15	I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
227	16320	16	And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
227	16321	17	And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names
227	16322	18	
227	16323	19	[Chorus]
227	16324	20	I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school
227	16325	21	But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
227	16326	22	Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
227	16327	23	But I know I had the best day with you today
227	16328	24	
227	16329	25	[Bridge]
227	16330	26	I have an excellent father
227	16331	27	His strength is making me stronger
227	16332	28	God smiles on my little brother
227	16333	29	Inside and out, he's better than I am
227	16334	30	I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run and I
227	16335	31	Had the best days with you
227	16336	32	
227	16337	33	[Verse 3]
227	16338	34	There is a video I found from back when I was three
227	16339	35	You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
227	16340	36	It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves
227	16341	37	Daddy's smart and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
227	16342	38	[Chorus]
227	16343	39	Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
227	16344	40	I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
227	16345	41	And I love you for giving me your eyes
227	16346	42	For staying back and watching me shine
227	16347	43	And I didn't know if you knew
227	16348	44	So I'm taking this chance to say
227	16349	45	That I had the best day with you today
228	15417	1	[Verse 1]
228	15418	2	Well, it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
228	15419	3	Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
228	15420	4	You know it’s all the same, another time and place
228	15421	5	Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
228	15422	6	But I believe in whatever you do
228	15423	7	And I'll do anything to see it through
228	15424	8	
228	15425	9	[Chorus]
228	15426	10	Because these things will change
228	15427	11	Can you feel it now?
228	15428	12	These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
228	15429	13	This revolution, the time will come
228	15430	14	For us to finally win
228	15431	15	And we’ll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
228	15432	16	Oh, oh
228	15433	17	[Verse 2]
228	15434	18	So we've been outnumbered, raidеd, and now cornered
228	15435	19	It's hard to fight when thе fight ain't fair
228	15436	20	We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
228	15437	21	They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
228	15438	22	You can walk away, say we don't need this
228	15439	23	But there’s something in your eyes says we can beat this
228	15440	24	
228	15441	25	[Chorus]
228	15442	26	’Cause these things will change
228	15443	27	Can you feel it now?
228	15444	28	These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
228	15445	29	This revolution, the time will come
228	15446	30	For us to finally win
228	15447	31	And we'll sing hallelujah, we’ll sing hallelujah
228	15448	32	Oh, oh
228	15449	33	
228	15450	34	[Bridge]
228	15451	35	Tonight, we'll stand, get off our knees
228	15452	36	Fight for what we've worked for all these years
228	15453	37	And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
228	15454	38	But we’ll stand up champions tonight
228	15455	39	
228	15456	40	[Chorus]
228	15457	41	It was the night things changed
228	15458	42	Can you see it now?
228	15459	43	When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
228	15460	44	It's a revolution, throw your hands up
228	15461	45	'Cause we never gave in
228	15462	46	And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
228	15463	47	Hallelujah
229	15864	1	[Verse 1]
229	15865	2	I like the way you sound in the mornin'
229	15866	3	We're on the phone and without a warnin'
229	15867	4	I realize your laugh is the best sound
229	15868	5	I have ever heard
229	15869	6	I like the way I can't keep my focus
229	15870	7	I watch you talk, you didn't notice
229	15871	8	I hear the words, but all I can think is
229	15872	9	"We should be together"
229	15873	10	
229	15874	11	[Pre-Chorus]
229	15875	12	Every time you smile, I smile
229	15876	13	And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

229	15886	23	[Verse 2]
229	15887	24	Huh, well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
229	15888	25	You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face, oh
229	15889	26	I've never been so wrapped up, honey
229	15890	27	I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
229	15891	28	I had time to think it oh-over
229	15892	29	And all I can say is, "Come closer"
229	15893	30	Take a deep breath and jump, then fall into me
229	15894	31	
229	15895	32	[Pre-Chorus]
229	15896	33	'Cause every time you smile, I smile

229	15908	45	The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
229	15909	46	I'll catch you, I'll catch you
229	15910	47	When people say things that bring you to your knees
229	15911	48	I'll catch you
229	15912	49	The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
229	15913	50	But I'll hold you through the night until you smile
229	15914	51	
229	15915	52	[Chorus]

230	16553	9	
230	16554	10	[Chorus]
230	16555	11	In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
230	16556	12	It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
230	16557	13	You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
230	16558	14	Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

230	16605	61	They're spelling out your name, oh
231	15672	1	[Taylor’s Version]
231	15673	2	Once upon a time
231	15674	3	I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
231	15675	4	And we caught onto something
231	15676	5	I hold on to the night
231	15677	6	You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
231	15678	7	Were you just kidding?
231	15679	8	'Cause it seems to me
231	15680	9	This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
231	15681	10	I don't feel welcome anymore
231	15682	11	What happened? Please, tell me
231	15683	12	'Cause one second it was perfect
231	15684	13	Now you're halfway out the door
231	15685	14	[Chorus]
231	15686	15	And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
231	15687	16	And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
231	15688	17	And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
231	15689	18	And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
231	15690	19	It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
231	15691	20	I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
231	15692	21	
231	15693	22	[Verse 2]
231	15694	23	Was I out of line?
231	15695	24	Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
231	15696	25	Like a scared little boy?
231	15697	26	I looked into your eyes
231	15698	27	Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
231	15699	28	So here's to everything coming down to nothing
231	15700	29	Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
231	15701	30	Where is this going?
231	15702	31	Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore
231	15703	32	
231	15704	33	[Chorus]
231	15705	34	And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
231	15706	35	And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
231	15707	36	You flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
231	15708	37	Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
231	15709	38	It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
231	15710	39	I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
231	15711	40	You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so
231	15712	41	[Bridge]
231	15713	42	Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
231	15714	43	Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
231	15715	44	Back up, baby, back up
231	15716	45	Did you forget everything?
231	15717	46	Back up, baby, back up
231	15718	47	Did you forget everything?
231	15719	48	Back up, baby, back up
231	15720	49	Please, back up, oh, back up
231	15721	50	Back up, baby, back up
231	15722	51	
231	15723	52	[Chorus]
231	15724	53	'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
231	15725	54	It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
231	15726	55	I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
231	15727	56	And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
231	15728	57	And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
231	15729	58	You flashback to when we said, "Forever and always"
231	15730	59	And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
231	15731	60	It rains when you're here, it rains when you're gone
231	15732	61	I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
231	15733	62	You didn't mean it, baby
231	15734	63	
231	15735	64	[Outro]
231	15736	65	You said, "Forever and always," yeah
232	15464	1	[Verse 1]
232	15465	2	I could go back to every laugh
232	15466	3	But I don't wanna go there anymore
232	15467	4	And I know all the steps up to your door
232	15468	5	But I don't wanna go there anymore
232	15469	6	
232	15470	7	[Pre-Chorus]
232	15471	8	Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
232	15472	9	Talk to the man with the reasons why
232	15473	10	And let me know what you find
232	15474	11	[Chorus]
232	15475	12	I'll leave my window open
232	15476	13	'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
232	15477	14	Just know I'm right here hoping
232	15478	15	That you'll come in with the rain
232	15479	16	
232	15480	17	[Verse 2]
232	15481	18	I could stand up and sing you a song
232	15482	19	But I don't wanna have to go that far
232	15483	20	And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
232	15484	21	And you don't even know where I start
232	15485	22	
232	15486	23	[Pre-Chorus]
232	15487	24	Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
232	15488	25	Talk to the man who put you here
232	15489	26	And don't wait for the sky to clear
232	15490	27	
232	15491	28	[Chorus]
232	15492	29	I'll leave my window open
232	15493	30	'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name, oh
232	15494	31	Just know I'm right here hoping
232	15495	32	That you'll come in with the rain
232	15496	33

232	15498	35	I've watched you so long, screamed your name
232	15499	36	I don't know what else I can say
232	15500	37	[Chorus]
232	15501	38	I'll leave my window open
232	15502	39	'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games
232	15503	40	Just know I'm right here hoping
232	15504	41	That you'll come in with the rain
232	15505	42	
232	15506	43	[Outro]
232	15507	44	I could go back to every laugh
232	15508	45	But I don't wanna go there anymore
233	16136	1	[Verse 1]
233	16137	2	This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
233	16138	3	There ain’t nothing more right, babe
233	16139	4	Misty morning comes again and I can't
233	16140	5	Help but wish I could see your face
233	16141	6	I knew from the first note played
233	16142	7	I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
233	16143	8	You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
233	16144	9	Scream your name
233	16145	10	
233	16146	11	[Chorus]
233	16147	12	So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
233	16148	13	"I can't keep my eyes off of you"
233	16149	14	I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
233	16150	15	Who's desperately in love with you
233	16151	16	Give me a photograph
233	16152	17	To hang on my wall, superstar
233	16153	18	[Verse 2]
233	16154	19	Morning lonelinеss comes around when I'm not
233	16155	20	Dreaming about you
233	16156	21	Whеn my world wakes up today
233	16157	22	You'll be in another town
233	16158	23	And I knew when I saw your face
233	16159	24	I'd be counting down the ways to see you
233	16160	25	You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
233	16161	26	Scream your name
233	16162	27

233	16168	33	Give me a photograph
233	16169	34	To hang on my wall, superstar
233	16170	35	
233	16171	36	[Bridge]
233	16172	37	You played in bars, you play guitar
233	16173	38	I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
233	16174	39	And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
233	16175	40	Every night from the radio
233	16176	41	
233	16177	42	[Chorus]

233	16186	51	Superstar
234	16350	1	[Verse 1]
234	16351	2	In the heat of the fight I walked away
234	16352	3	Ignorin' words that you were sayin'
234	16353	4	Tryna make me stay
234	16354	5	I said, "This time I've had enough"
234	16355	6	And you've called a hundred times
234	16356	7	But I'm not picking up
234	16357	8	
234	16358	9	[Pre-Chorus]
234	16359	10	'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
234	16360	11	But if you look a little closer
234	16361	12	[Chorus]
234	16362	13	I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
234	16363	14	To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
234	16364	15	Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
234	16365	16	Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
234	16366	17	And don't you leave 'cause I know
234	16367	18	All I need is on the other side of the door
234	16368	19	
234	16369	20	[Verse 2]
234	16370	21	Me and my stupid pride are sittin' here alone
234	16371	22	Goin' through the photographs, starin' at the phone
234	16372	23	I keep goin' back over things we both said
234	16373	24	And I remember the slamming door

238	16607	2	We used to walk along the streets
238	16608	3	When the porch lights were shining bright
238	16609	4	Before I had somewhere to be
238	16610	5	Back when we had all night and we were happy
238	16611	6	I do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus
238	16612	7	You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it

238	16617	12	We showed 'em all up
238	16618	13	No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
238	16619	14	Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
238	16620	15	And we were happy
238	16621	16	[Verse 2]
238	16622	17	We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
238	16623	18	That's sorta how I feel right now

238	16634	29	[Bridge]
238	16635	30	Oh, I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore
238	16636	31	But they don't give me choices and that's what these tears are for
238	16637	32	'Cause we were happy

242	16002	5	On a balcony in summer air
242	16003	6	See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
242	15366	6	Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
242	15367	7	'Cause I, I still love you but I can't
242	16004	7	See you make your way through the crowd
242	16005	8	And say, "Hello"
242	15368	8	
242	15369	9	[Chorus]
242	16006	9	Little did I know
242	16007	10	
242	15370	10	Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
242	15371	11	Bye bye, baby
242	16008	11	[Pre-Chorus]
242	16009	12	That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
242	15372	12	I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
242	15373	13	And all I have is your sympathy
242	16010	13	And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
242	16011	14	And I was crying on the staircase
242	15374	14	'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
242	15375	15	Bye bye, baby
242	16012	15	Begging you, "Please don't go"
242	16013	16	And I said
242	15376	16	Bye bye, baby
242	15377	17	[Verse 2]
242	16014	17	[Chorus]
242	16015	18	Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
242	15378	18	The picture frame is empty
242	15379	19	On the dresser, vacant just like me
242	16016	19	I'll be waiting, all therе's left to do is run
242	16017	20	You'll be the princе and I'll be the princess
242	15380	20	I see your writing on the dash
242	15381	21	Then back to your hesitation
242	16018	21	It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
242	16019	22	
242	15382	22	I was so sure of everything
242	15383	23	Everything I thought we'd always have
242	16020	23	[Verse 2]
242	16021	24	So I sneak out to the garden to see you
242	15384	24	Guess I never doubted it
242	15385	25	Then the here and the now floods in
242	16022	25	We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
242	16023	26	So close your eyes
242	15386	26	Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past
242	15387	27	
242	16024	27	Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
242	16025	28	
242	15388	28	[Chorus]
242	15389	29	Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
242	16026	29	[Pre-Chorus]
242	16027	30	'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
242	15390	30	Bye bye, baby
242	15391	31	I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
242	16028	31	And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
242	16029	32	But you were everything to me
242	15392	32	And all I have is your sympathy
242	15393	33	'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
242	16030	33	I was begging you, "Please don't go"
242	16031	34	And I said
242	15394	34	Bye bye, baby
242	15395	35	
242	16032	35	
242	16033	36	[Chorus]
242	15396	36	[Bridge]
242	15397	37	And there's so much that I can't touch
242	16034	37	Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
242	16035	38	I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
242	15398	38	You're all I want but it's not enough this time
242	15399	39	And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
242	16036	39	You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
242	16037	40	It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
242	15400	40	And I'm so scared of how this ends
242	15401	41	
242	16038	41	Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
242	16039	42	This love is difficult, but it's real
242	15402	42	[Chorus]
242	15403	43	Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
242	16040	43	Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
242	16041	44	It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
242	15404	44	Bye bye, baby
242	15405	45	I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
242	16042	45	Oh, oh
242	16043	46	[Bridge]
242	15406	46	And all I have is your sympathy
242	15407	47	'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
242	16044	47	But I got tired of waiting
242	16045	48	Wondering if you were ever coming around
242	15408	48	[Chorus]
242	15409	49	Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
242	16046	49	My faith in you was fading
242	16047	50	When I met you on the outskirts of town
242	15410	50	Bye bye, baby
242	15411	51	I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
242	16048	51	
242	16049	52	[Chorus]
242	15412	52	And all I have is your sympathy
242	15413	53	'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
242	16050	53	And I said, "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
242	16051	54	I keep waiting for you, but you never come"
242	15414	54	Oh, you took me home, I thought you were gonna keep me
242	15415	55	Bye bye, baby
242	16052	55	Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
242	16053	56	He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
242	15416	56	Bye bye, baby
242	16054	57	"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
242	16055	58	I love you and that's all I really know
242	16056	59	I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
242	16057	60	It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"
242	16058	61	
242	16059	62	[Outro]
242	16060	63	Oh, oh, oh
242	16061	64	Oh, oh, oh
242	16062	65	'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
267	18999	1	[Verse 1]
267	19000	2	I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
267	19001	3	Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
267	19002	4	I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
267	19003	5	I hit the ground running each night
267	19004	6	I hit the Sunday matinée
267	19005	7	You know the greatest films of all time were never made
267	19006	8	
267	19007	9	[Pre-Chorus]
267	19008	10	I guess you never know, never know
267	19009	11	And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
267	19010	12	And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
267	19011	13	And it's alright now
267	19012	14	
267	19013	15	[Chorus]
267	19014	16	But we were something, don't you think so?
267	19015	17	Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
267	19016	18	And if my wishes came true
267	19017	19	It would've been you
267	19018	20	In my defense, I have none
267	19019	21	For never leaving well enough alone
267	19020	22	But it would've been fun
267	19021	23	If you would've been the one
267	19022	24	(Ooh)
267	19023	25	
267	19024	26	[Verse 2]
267	19025	27	I have this dream you're doing cool shit
267	19026	28	Having adventures on your own
267	19027	29	You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
267	19028	30	We never painted by the numbers, baby
267	19029	31	But we were making it count
267	19030	32	You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
267	19031	33	[Pre-Chorus]
267	19032	34	I guess you never know, never know
267	19033	35	And it's another day waking up alone
267	19034	36	
267	19035	37	[Chorus]
267	19036	38	But we were something, don't you think so?
267	19037	39	Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
267	19038	40	And if my wishes came true
267	19039	41	It would've been you
267	19040	42	In my defense, I have none
267	19041	43	For never leaving well enough alone
267	19042	44	But it would've been fun
267	19043	45	If you would've been the one
267	19044	46	
267	19045	47	[Bridge]
267	19046	48	I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
267	19047	49	If one thing had been different
267	19048	50	Would everything be different today?
267	19049	51	
267	19050	52	[Chorus]
267	19051	53	We were something, don't you think so?
267	19052	54	Rosé flowing with your chosen family
267	19053	55	And it would've been sweet
267	19054	56	If it could've been me
267	19055	57	In my defense, I have none
267	19056	58	For digging up the grave another time
267	19057	59	But it would've been fun
267	19058	60	If you would've been the one
267	19059	61	(Ooh)10
268	18419	1	[Verse 1]
268	18420	2	Vintage tee, brand new phone
268	18421	3	High heels on cobblestones
268	18422	4	When you are young, they assume you know nothing
268	18423	5	Sequin smile, black lipstick
268	18424	6	Sensual politics
268	18425	7	When you are young, they assume you know nothing
268	18426	8	
268	18427	9	[Chorus]
268	18428	10	But I knew you
268	18429	11	Dancin' in your Levi's
268	18430	12	Drunk under a streetlight, I
268	18431	13	I knew you
268	18432	14	Hand under my sweatshirt
268	18433	15	Baby, kiss it better, I
268	18434	16	
268	18435	17	[Refrain]
268	18436	18	And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
268	18437	19	Under someone's bed
268	18438	20	You put me on and said I was your favorite
268	18439	21	
268	18440	22	[Verse 2]
268	18441	23	A friend to all is a friend to none
268	18442	24	Chase two girls, lose the one
268	18443	25	When you are young, they assume you know nothing
268	18444	26	[Chorus]
268	18445	27	But I knew you
268	18446	28	Playing hide-and-seek and
268	18447	29	Giving me your weekends, I
268	18448	30	I knew you
268	18449	31	Your heartbeat on the High Line
268	18450	32	Once in twenty lifetimes, I
268	18451	33	
268	18452	34	[Refrain]
268	18453	35	And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
268	18454	36	Under someone's bed
268	18455	37	You put me on and said I was your favorite
268	18456	38	
268	18457	39	[Bridge]
268	18458	40	To kiss in cars and downtown bars
268	18459	41	Was all we needed
268	18460	42	You drew stars around my scars
268	18461	43	But now I'm bleedin'
268	18462	44	
268	18463	45	[Chorus]
268	18464	46	'Cause I knew you
268	18465	47	Steppin' on the last train
268	18466	48	Marked me like a bloodstain, I
268	18467	49	I knew you
268	18468	50	Tried to change the ending
268	18469	51	Peter losing Wendy, I
268	18470	52	I knew you
268	18471	53	Leavin' like a father
268	18472	54	Running like water, I
268	18473	55	And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
268	18474	56	[Verse 3]
268	18475	57	But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
268	18476	58	I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
268	18477	59	The smell of smoke would hang around this long
268	18478	60	'Cause I knew everything when I was young
268	18479	61	I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
268	18480	62	Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
268	18481	63	I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
268	18482	64	And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
268	18483	65	And I knew you'd come back to me
268	18484	66	You'd come back to me
268	18485	67	And you'd come back to me
268	18486	68	And you'd come back
268	18487	69	
268	18488	70	[Refrain]
268	18489	71	And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
268	18490	72	Under someone's bed
268	18491	73	You put me on and said I was your favorite16
269	19060	1	[Verse 1]
269	19061	2	Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
269	19062	3	Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
269	19063	4	Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
269	19064	5	And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorcée do it?"
269	19065	6	The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
269	19066	7	There's only so far new money goes
269	19067	8	They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"
269	19068	9	Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
269	19069	10	The doctor had told him to settle down
269	19070	11	It must have been her fault his heart gave out
269	19071	12	
269	19072	13	[Chorus]
269	19073	14	And they said
269	19074	15	"There goes the last great American dynasty
269	19075	16	Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
269	19076	17	There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
269	19077	18	She had a marvelous time ruining everything"
269	19078	19	
269	19079	20	[Verse 2]
269	19080	21	Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
269	19081	22	Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
269	19082	23	Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
269	19083	24	And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
269	19084	25	And losing on card game bets with Dalí
269	19085	26	[Chorus]
269	19086	27	And they said
269	19087	28	"There goes the last great American dynasty
269	19088	29	Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
269	19089	30	There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
269	19090	31	She had a marvelous time ruining everything"
269	19091	32	
269	19092	33	[Bridge]
269	19093	34	They say she was seen on occasion
269	19094	35	Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
269	19095	36	And in a feud with her neighbor
269	19096	37	She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
269	19097	38	Fifty years is a long time
269	19098	39	Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
269	19099	40	Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
269	19100	41	And then it was bought by me
269	19101	42	
269	19102	43	[Chorus]
269	19103	44	Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been
269	19104	45	There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
269	19105	46	I had a marvelous time ruining everything
269	19106	47	
269	19107	48	[Outro]
269	19108	49	I had a marvelous time ruining everything
269	19109	50	A marvelous time ruining everything
269	19110	51	A marvelous time
269	19111	52	I had a marvelous time7
270	18526	1	[Verse 1: Justin Vernon]
270	18527	2	I can see you standing, honey
270	18528	3	With his arms around your body
270	18529	4	Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
270	18530	5	And it took you five whole minutes
270	18531	6	To pack us up and leave me with it
270	18532	7	Holdin' all this love out here in the hall
270	18533	8	
270	18534	9	[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
270	18535	10	I think I've seen this film before
270	18536	11	And I didn't like the ending
270	18537	12	You're not my homeland anymore
270	18538	13	So what am I defending now?
270	18539	14	You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
270	18540	15	I think I've seen this film before
270	18541	16	
270	18542	17	[Post-Chorus: Justin Vernon]
270	18543	18	Ooh, ooh, ooh
270	18544	19	
270	18545	20	[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
270	18546	21	I can see you starin', honey
270	18547	22	Like he's just your understudy
270	18548	23	Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
270	18549	24	Second, third, and hundredth chances
270	18550	25	Balancin' on breaking branches
270	18551	26	Those eyes add insult to injury
270	18552	27	[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
270	18553	28	I think I've seen this film before
270	18554	29	And I didn't like the ending
270	18555	30	I'm not your problem anymore
270	18556	31	So who am I offending now?
270	18557	32	You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
270	18558	33	I think I've seen this film before
270	18559	34	So I'm leaving out the side door
270	18560	35	[Bridge: Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift & Both]
270	18561	36	So step right out, there is no amount
270	18562	37	Of crying I can do for you
270	18563	38	All this time
270	18564	39	We always walked a very thin line
270	18565	40	You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
270	18566	41	You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
270	18567	42	All this time
270	18568	43	I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
270	18569	44	I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
270	18570	45	'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
270	18571	46	So many signs, so many signs
270	18572	47	You didn't even see the signs
270	18573	48	
270	18574	49	[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift]
270	18575	50	I think I've seen this film before
270	18576	51	And I didn't like the ending
270	18577	52	You're not my homeland anymore
270	18578	53	So what am I defending now?
270	18579	54	You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
270	18580	55	I think I've seen this film before
270	18581	56	So I'm leavin' out the side door
270	18582	57	[Outro: Justin Vernon & Taylor Swift]
270	18583	58	So step right out, there is no amount
270	18584	59	Of crying I can do for you
270	18585	60	All this time
270	18586	61	We always walked a very thin line
270	18587	62	You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out)
270	18588	63	You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
270	18589	64	All this time
270	18590	65	I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
270	18591	66	I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
270	18592	67	'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
270	18593	68	You never gave a warning sign (All this time)
270	18594	69	(So many times) I never learned to read your mind
270	18595	70	(So many signs) I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around)
270	18596	71	'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)
270	18597	72	You never gave a warning sign
270	18598	73	Ah, ah10
271	18868	1	[Verse 1]
271	18869	2	We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
271	18870	3	And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
271	18871	4	Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
271	18872	5	All the hell you gave me?
271	18873	6	'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
271	18874	7	'Til my dying day
271	18875	8	
271	18876	9	[Chorus]
271	18877	10	I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
271	18878	11	And you're the hero flying around, saving face
271	18879	12	And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
271	18880	13	Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
271	18881	14	Look at how my tears ricochet
271	18882	15	
271	18883	16	[Verse 2]
271	18884	17	We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
271	18885	18	Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
271	18886	19	You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
271	18887	20	But what a ghostly scene
271	18888	21	You wear the same jewels that I gave you
271	18889	22	As you bury me
271	18890	23	
271	18891	24	[Chorus]
271	18892	25	I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
271	18893	26	'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
271	18894	27	And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
271	18895	28	Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
271	18896	29	Look at how my tears ricochet
271	18897	30	[Bridge]
271	18898	31	And I can go anywhere I want
271	18899	32	Anywhere I want, just not home
271	18900	33	And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
271	18901	34	But you would still miss me in your bones
271	18902	35	And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)
271	18903	36	And when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies)
271	18904	37	
271	18905	38	[Chorus]
271	18906	39	I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
271	18907	40	And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
271	18908	41	You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
271	18909	42	Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
271	18910	43	You turned into your worst fears
271	18911	44	And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
271	18912	45	Crossing out the good years
271	18913	46	And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed
271	18914	47	Look at how my tears ricochet
272	18819	1	[Verse 1]
272	18820	2	I want you to know
272	18821	3	I'm a mirrorball
272	18822	4	I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
272	18823	5	I'll get you out on the floor
272	18824	6	Shimmering beautiful
272	18825	7	And when I break, it's in a million pieces
272	18826	8	
272	18827	9	[Chorus]
272	18828	10	Hush, when no one is around, my dear
272	18829	11	You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
272	18830	12	Spinning in my highest heels, love
272	18831	13	Shining just for you
272	18832	14	Hush, I know they said the end is near
272	18833	15	But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
272	18834	16	Spinning in my highest heels, love
272	18835	17	Shining just for you
272	18836	18	
272	18837	19	[Verse 2]
272	18838	20	I want you to know
272	18839	21	I'm a mirrorball
272	18840	22	I can change everything about me to fit in
272	18841	23	You are not like the regulars
272	18842	24	The masquerade revelers
272	18843	25	Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten
272	18844	26	[Chorus]
272	18845	27	Hush, when no one is around, my dear
272	18846	28	You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
272	18847	29	Spinning in my highest heels, love
272	18848	30	Shining just for you
272	18849	31	Hush, I know they said the end is near
272	18850	32	But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
272	18851	33	Spinning in my highest heels, love
272	18852	34	Shining just for you
272	18853	35	
272	18854	36	[Bridge]
272	18855	37	And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
272	18856	38	When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
272	18857	39	I'm still on that tightrope
272	18858	40	I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
272	18859	41	And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why
272	18860	42	I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
272	18861	43	I'm still on that trapeze
272	18862	44	I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me
272	18863	45	
272	18864	46	[Outro]
272	18865	47	Because I'm a mirrorball
272	18866	48	I'm a mirrorball
272	18867	49	And I'll show you every version of yourself tonight6
273	18954	1	[Verse 1]
273	18955	2	Please picture me in the trees
273	18956	3	I hit my peak at seven
273	18957	4	Feet in the swing over the creek
273	18958	5	I was too scared to jump in
273	18959	6	But I, I was high in the sky
273	18960	7	With Pennsylvania under me
273	18961	8	Are there still beautiful things?
273	18962	9	
273	18963	10	[Chorus]
273	18964	11	Sweet tea in the summer
273	18965	12	Cross your heart, won't tell no other
273	18966	13	And though I can’t recall your face
273	18967	14	I still got love for you
273	18968	15	Your braids like a pattern
273	18969	16	Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
273	18970	17	Passed down like folk songs
273	18971	18	The love lasts so long
273	18972	19	
273	18973	20	[Bridge]
273	18974	21	And I've been meaning to tell you
273	18975	22	I think your house is haunted
273	18976	23	Your dad is always mad and that must be why
273	18977	24	And I think you should come live with me
273	18978	25	And we can be pirates
273	18979	26	Then you won't have to cry
273	18980	27	Or hide in the closet
273	18981	28	And just like a folk song
273	18982	29	Our love will be passed on
273	18983	30	[Verse 2]
273	18984	31	Please picture me in the weeds
273	18985	32	Before I learned civility
273	18986	33	I used to scream ferociously
273	18987	34	Any time I wanted
273	18988	35	I, I
273	18989	36	
273	18990	37	[Chorus]
273	18991	38	Sweet tea in the summer
273	18992	39	Cross my heart, won’t tell no other
273	18993	40	And though I can't recall your face
273	18994	41	I still got love for you
273	18995	42	Pack your dolls and a sweater
273	18996	43	We'll move to India forever
273	18997	44	Passed down like folk songs
273	18998	45	Our love lasts so long8
274	18270	1	[Verse 1]
274	18271	2	Salt air, and the rust on your door
274	18272	3	I never needed anything more
274	18273	4	Whispers of "Are you sure?"
274	18274	5	"Never have I ever before"
274	18275	6	
274	18276	7	[Chorus]
274	18277	8	But I can see us lost in the memory
274	18278	9	August slipped away into a moment in time
274	18279	10	'Cause it was never mine
274	18280	11	And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
274	18281	12	August sipped away like a bottle of wine
274	18282	13	'Cause you were never mine
274	18283	14	
274	18284	15	[Verse 2]
274	18285	16	Your back beneath the sun
274	18286	17	Wishin' I could write my name on it
274	18287	18	Will you call when you're back at school?
274	18288	19	I remember thinkin' I had you
274	18289	20	
274	18290	21	[Chorus]
274	18291	22	But I can see us lost in the memory
274	18292	23	August slipped away into a moment in time
274	18293	24	'Cause it was never mine
274	18294	25	And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
274	18295	26	August sipped away like a bottle of wine
274	18296	27	'Cause you were never mine
274	18297	28	[Bridge]
274	18298	29	Back when we were still changin' for the better
274	18299	30	Wanting was enough
274	18300	31	For me, it was enough
274	18301	32	To live for the hope of it all
274	18302	33	Cancel plans just in case you'd call
274	18303	34	And say, "Meet me behind the mall"
274	18304	35	So much for summer love and saying "us"
274	18305	36	'Cause you weren't mine to lose
274	18306	37	You weren't mine to lose, no
274	18307	38	
274	18308	39	[Chorus]
274	18309	40	But I can see us lost in the memory
274	18310	41	August slipped away into a moment in time
274	18311	42	'Cause it was never mine
274	18312	43	And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
274	18313	44	August sipped away like a bottle of wine
274	18314	45	'Cause you were never mine
274	18315	46	
274	18316	47	[Outro]
274	18317	48	'Cause you were never mine
274	18318	49	Never mine
274	18319	50	But do you remember?
274	18320	51	Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
274	18321	52	And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
274	18322	53	Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
274	18323	54	"Meet me behind the mall"
274	18324	55	(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car")
274	18325	56	(And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?)
274	18326	57	(Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
274	18327	58	("Meet me behind the mall")
274	18328	59	Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
274	18329	60	And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
274	18330	61	Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)
274	18331	62	For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
274	18332	63	(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
275	19112	1	[Verse 1]
275	19113	2	I've been having a hard time adjusting
275	19114	3	I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
275	19115	4	I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
275	19116	5	I have a lot of regrets about that
275	19117	6	Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
275	19118	7	Could've followed my fears all the way down
275	19119	8	And maybe I don't quite know what to say
275	19120	9	But I'm here in your doorway
275	19121	10	
275	19122	11	[Chorus]
275	19123	12	I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
275	19124	13	I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
275	19125	14	[Verse 2]
275	19126	15	They told me all of my cages were mental
275	19127	16	So I got wasted like all my potential
275	19128	17	And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
275	19129	18	I have a lot of regrets about that
275	19130	19	I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
275	19131	20	Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
275	19132	21	Pouring out my heart to a stranger
275	19133	22	But I didn't pour the whiskey
275	19134	23	
275	19135	24	[Chorus]
275	19136	25	I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
275	19137	26	I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
275	19138	27	[Post-Chorus]
275	19139	28	At least I'm trying
275	19140	29	
275	19141	30	[Bridge]
275	19142	31	And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
275	19143	32	It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
275	19144	33	You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town
275	19145	34	
275	19146	35	[Chorus]
275	19147	36	And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
275	19148	37	(And maybe I don't quite know what to say)
275	19149	38	I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
275	19150	39	
275	19151	40	[Outro]
275	19152	41	At least I'm trying7
276	18647	1	[Verse 1]
276	18648	2	Make sure nobody sees you leave
276	18649	3	Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
276	18650	4	Tell your friends you're out for a run
276	18651	5	You’ll be flushed when you return
276	18652	6	Take the road less traveled by
276	18653	7	Tell yourself you can always stop
276	18654	8	What started in beautiful rooms
276	18655	9	Ends with meetings in parking lots
276	18656	10	
276	18657	11	[Chorus]
276	18658	12	And that's the thing about illicit affairs
276	18659	13	And clandestine meetings and longing stares
276	18660	14	It's born from just one single glance
276	18661	15	But it dies and it dies and it dies
276	18662	16	A million little times
276	18663	17	
276	18664	18	[Verse 2]
276	18665	19	Leave the perfume on the shelf
276	18666	20	That you picked out just for him
276	18667	21	So you leave no trace behind
276	18668	22	Like you don’t even exist
276	18669	23	Take the words for what they are
276	18670	24	A dwindling, mercurial high
276	18671	25	A drug that only worked
276	18672	26	The first few hundred times
276	18673	27	[Chorus]
276	18674	28	And that's the thing about illicit affairs
276	18675	29	And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
276	18676	30	They show their truth one single time
276	18677	31	But they lie and they lie and they lie
276	18678	32	A million little times
276	18679	33	
276	18680	34	[Bridge]
276	18681	35	And you wanna scream
276	18682	36	Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
276	18683	37	Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
276	18684	38	You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
276	18685	39	Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
276	18686	40	Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
276	18687	41	You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else
276	18688	42	
276	18689	43	[Outro]
276	18690	44	And you know damn well
276	18691	45	For you, I would ruin myself
276	18692	46	A million little times8
277	18693	1	[Verse 1]
277	18694	2	Green was the color of the grass
277	18695	3	Where I used to read at Centennial Park
277	18696	4	I used to think I would meet somebody there
277	18697	5	Teal was the color of your shirt
277	18698	6	When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
277	18699	7	You used to work at to make a little money
277	18700	8	
277	18701	9	[Chorus]
277	18702	10	Time, curious time
277	18703	11	Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
277	18704	12	Were there clues I didn't see?
277	18705	13	And isn't it just so pretty to think
277	18706	14	All along there was some
277	18707	15	Invisible string
277	18708	16	Tying you to me?
277	18709	17	Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
277	18710	18	
277	18711	19	[Verse 2]
277	18712	20	Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
277	18713	21	On your first trip to LA
277	18714	22	You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
277	18715	23	Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
277	18716	24	Getting lunch down by the Lakes
277	18717	25	She said I looked like an American singer
277	18718	26	[Chorus]
277	18719	27	Time, mystical time
277	18720	28	Cutting me open, then healing me fine
277	18721	29	Were there clues I didn't see?
277	18722	30	And isn't it just so pretty to think
277	18723	31	All along there was some
277	18724	32	Invisible string
277	18725	33	Tying you to me?
277	18726	34	Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
277	18727	35	
277	18728	36	[Bridge]
277	18729	37	A string that pulled me
277	18730	38	Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
277	18731	39	Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
277	18732	40	Chains around my demons
277	18733	41	Wool to brave the seasons
277	18734	42	One single thread of gold
277	18735	43	Tied me to you
277	18736	44	
277	18737	45	[Verse 3]
277	18738	46	Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
277	18739	47	For the boys who broke my heart
277	18740	48	Now I send their babies presents
277	18741	49	Gold was the color of the leaves
277	18742	50	When I showed you around Centennial Park
277	18743	51	Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven
277	18744	52	[Chorus]
277	18745	53	Time, wondrous time
277	18746	54	Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
277	18747	55	And it's cool
277	18748	56	Baby, with me
277	18749	57	And isn't it just so pretty to think
277	18750	58	All along there was some
277	18751	59	Invisible string
277	18752	60	Tying you to me?
277	18753	61	Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
277	18754	62	Me
277	18755	63	Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
277	18756	64	
277	18757	65	[Outro]
277	18758	66	(Ah-ah-ah)
277	18759	67	(Ah-ah-ah)6
278	18760	1	[Verse 1]
278	18761	2	What did you think I'd say to that?
278	18762	3	Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
278	18763	4	They strike to kill, and you know I will
278	18764	5	You know I will
278	18765	6	What do you sing on your drive home?
278	18766	7	Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
278	18767	8	Does she smile?
278	18768	9	Or does she mouth, "Fuck you forever"?
278	18769	10	
278	18770	11	[Pre-Chorus]
278	18771	12	Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
278	18772	13	What about that?
278	18773	14	And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry
278	18774	15	
278	18775	16	[Chorus]
278	18776	17	And there's nothing like a mad woman
278	18777	18	What a shame she went mad
278	18778	19	No one likes a mad woman
278	18779	20	You made her like that
278	18780	21	And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
278	18781	22	And you find something to wrap your noose around
278	18782	23	And there's nothing like a mad woman
278	18783	24	
278	18784	25	[Verse 2]
278	18785	26	Now I breathe flames each time I talk
278	18786	27	My cannons all firin' at your yacht
278	18787	28	They say "move on," but you know I won't
278	18788	29	And women like hunting witches too
278	18789	30	Doing your dirtiest work for you
278	18790	31	It's obvious that wanting me dead
278	18791	32	Has really brought you two together
278	18792	33	[Pre-Chorus]
278	18793	34	Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
278	18794	35	What about that?
278	18795	36	And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry
278	18796	37	
278	18797	38	[Chorus]
278	18798	39	And there's nothing like a mad woman
278	18799	40	What a shame she went mad
278	18800	41	No one likes a mad woman
278	18801	42	You made her like that
278	18802	43	And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
278	18803	44	And you find something to wrap your noose around
278	18804	45	And there's nothing like a mad woman
278	18805	46	
278	18806	47	[Bridge]
278	18807	48	I'm taking my time, taking my time
278	18808	49	'Cause you took everything from me
278	18809	50	Watching you climb, watching you climb
278	18810	51	Over people like me
278	18811	52	The master of spin has a couple side flings
278	18812	53	Good wives always know
278	18813	54	She should be mad, should be scathing like me, but
278	18814	55	
278	18815	56	[Outro]
278	18816	57	No one likes a mad woman
278	18817	58	What a shame she went mad
278	18818	59	You made her like that
279	18492	1	[Verse 1]
279	18493	2	Keep your helmet, keep your life, son
279	18494	3	Just a flesh wound, here's your rifle
279	18495	4	Crawling up the beaches now
279	18496	5	"Sir, I think he's bleeding out"
279	18497	6	And some things you just can't speak about
279	18498	7	
279	18499	8	[Chorus]
279	18500	9	With you I serve, with you I fall down, down
279	18501	10	Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
279	18502	11	
279	18503	12	[Verse 2]
279	18504	13	Something med school did not cover
279	18505	14	Someone's daughter, someone's mother
279	18506	15	Holds your hand through plastic now
279	18507	16	"Doc, I think she's crashing out"
279	18508	17	And some things you just can't speak about
279	18509	18	
279	18510	19	[Bridge]
279	18511	20	Only twenty minutes to sleep
279	18512	21	But you dream of some epiphany
279	18513	22	Just one single glimpse of relief
279	18514	23	To make some sense of what you've seen
279	18515	24	
279	18516	25	[Chorus]
279	18517	26	With you I serve, with you I fall down, down (Down)
279	18518	27	Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
279	18519	28	With you I serve (With you I serve), with you I fall down (Down), down (Down)
279	18520	29	Watch you breathe in (Watch you breathe in), watch you breathing out (Out), out (Out)
279	18521	30	[Outro]
279	18522	31	Only twenty minutes to sleep
279	18523	32	But you dream of some epiphany
279	18524	33	Just one single glimpse of relief
279	18525	34	To make some sense of what you've seen7
280	18333	1	[Verse 1]
280	18334	2	Betty, I won't make assumptions
280	18335	3	About why you switched your homeroom, but
280	18336	4	I think it's 'cause of me
280	18337	5	Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
280	18338	6	When I passed your house
280	18339	7	It's like I couldn't breathe
280	18340	8	
280	18341	9	[Pre-Chorus]
280	18342	10	You heard the rumors from Inez
280	18343	11	You can't believe a word she says
280	18344	12	Most times, but this time it was true
280	18345	13	The worst thing that I ever did
280	18346	14	Was what I did to you
280	18347	15	
280	18348	16	[Chorus]
280	18349	17	But if I just showed up at your party
280	18350	18	Would you have me? Would you want me?
280	18351	19	Would you tell me to go fuck myself
280	18352	20	Or lead me to the garden?
280	18353	21	In the garden, would you trust me
280	18354	22	If I told you it was just a summer thing?
280	18355	23	I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
280	18356	24	But I know I miss you
280	18357	25	
280	18358	26	[Verse 2]
280	18359	27	Betty, I know where it all went wrong
280	18360	28	Your favorite song was playing
280	18361	29	From the far side of the gym
280	18362	30	I was nowhere to be found
280	18363	31	I hate the crowds, you know that
280	18364	32	Plus, I saw you dance with him
280	18365	33	[Pre-Chorus]
280	18366	34	You heard the rumors from Inez
280	18367	35	You can't believe a word she says
280	18368	36	Most times, but this time it was true
280	18369	37	The worst thing that I ever did
280	18370	38	Was what I did to you
280	18371	39	
280	18372	40	[Chorus]
280	18373	41	But if I just showed up at your party
280	18374	42	Would you have me? Would you want me?
280	18375	43	Would you tell me to go fuck myself
280	18376	44	Or lead me to the garden?
280	18377	45	In the garden, would you trust me
280	18378	46	If I told you it was just a summer thing?
280	18379	47	I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
280	18380	48	But I know I miss you
280	18381	49	
280	18382	50	[Bridge]
280	18383	51	I was walking home on broken cobblestones
280	18384	52	Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
280	18385	53	A figment of my worst intentions
280	18386	54	She said "James, get in, let's drive"
280	18387	55	Those days turned into nights
280	18388	56	Slept next to her, but
280	18389	57	I dreamt of you all summer long
280	18390	58	[Verse 3]
280	18391	59	Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
280	18392	60	And I planned it out for weeks now
280	18393	61	But it's finally sinkin' in
280	18394	62	Betty, right now is the last time
280	18395	63	I can dream about what happens when
280	18396	64	You see my face again
280	18397	65	
280	18398	66	[Pre-Chorus]
280	18399	67	The only thing I wanna do
280	18400	68	Is make it up to you
280	18401	69	So I showed up at your party
280	18402	70	Yeah, I showed up at your party
280	18403	71	
280	18404	72	[Chorus]
280	18405	73	Yeah, I showed up at your party
280	18406	74	Will you have me? Will you love me?
280	18407	75	Will you kiss me on the porch
280	18408	76	In front of all your stupid friends?
280	18409	77	If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
280	18410	78	Will it patch your broken wings?
280	18411	79	I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
280	18412	80	But I know I miss you
280	18413	81	
280	18414	82	[Outro]
280	18415	83	Standing in your cardigan
280	18416	84	Kissin' in my car again
280	18417	85	Stopped at a streetlight
280	18418	86	You know I miss you9
281	18915	1	[Verse 1]
281	18916	2	Our coming-of-age has come and gone
281	18917	3	Suddenly this summer, it's clear
281	18918	4	I never had the courage of my convictions
281	18919	5	As long as danger is near
281	18920	6	And it's just around the corner, darlin'
281	18921	7	'Cause it lives in me
281	18922	8	No, I could never give you peace
281	18923	9	
281	18924	10	[Chorus]
281	18925	11	But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
281	18926	12	If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
281	18927	13	All these people think love's for show
281	18928	14	But I would die for you in secret
281	18929	15	The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
281	18930	16	Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
281	18931	17	
281	18932	18	[Verse 2]
281	18933	19	Your integrity makes me seem small
281	18934	20	You paint dreamscapes on the wall
281	18935	21	I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
281	18936	22	And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
281	18937	23	Sit with you in the trenches
281	18938	24	Give you my wild, give you a child
281	18939	25	Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
281	18940	26	Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
281	18941	27	Is it enough?
281	18942	28	But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
281	18943	29	I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
281	18944	30	But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me
281	18945	31	[Chorus]
281	18946	32	But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
281	18947	33	If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
281	18948	34	All these people think love's for show
281	18949	35	But I would die for you in secret
281	18950	36	The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
281	18951	37	Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
281	18952	38	Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
281	18953	39	Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?5
282	18599	1	[Verse 1]
282	18600	2	My only one
282	18601	3	My smoking gun
282	18602	4	My eclipsed sun
282	18603	5	This has broken me down
282	18604	6	My twisted knife
282	18605	7	My sleepless night
282	18606	8	My winless fight
282	18607	9	This has frozen my ground
282	18608	10	
282	18609	11	[Chorus]
282	18610	12	Stood on the cliffside screaming, "Give me a reason"
282	18611	13	Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
282	18612	14	Don't want no other shade of blue but you
282	18613	15	No other sadness in the world would do
282	18614	16	
282	18615	17	[Verse 2]
282	18616	18	My best laid plan
282	18617	19	Your sleight of hand
282	18618	20	My barren land
282	18619	21	I am ash from your fire
282	18620	22	
282	18621	23	[Chorus]
282	18622	24	Stood on the cliffside screaming, "Give me a reason"
282	18623	25	Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
282	18624	26	Don't want no other shade of blue but you
282	18625	27	No other sadness in the world would do
282	18626	28	[Bridge]
282	18627	29	You know I left a part of me back in New York
282	18628	30	You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?
282	18629	31	You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
282	18630	32	From when they pulled me apart
282	18631	33	You knew the password so I let you in the door
282	18632	34	You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
282	18633	35	You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
282	18634	36	From when they pulled me apart
282	18635	37	But what you did was just as dark
282	18636	38	(Ah, ah, ah)
282	18637	39	Darling, this was just as hard
282	18638	40	As when they pulled me apart
282	18639	41	
282	18640	42	[Outro]
282	18641	43	My only one
282	18642	44	My kingdom come undone
282	18643	45	My broken drum
282	18644	46	You have beaten my heart
282	18645	47	Don't want no other shade of blue but you
282	18646	48	No other sadness in the world would do5
305	20850	1	[Verse 1]
305	20851	2	How many days did I spend thinking
305	20852	3	'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
305	20853	4	Lived in the shade you were throwing
305	20854	5	'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
305	20855	6	And I couldn't get away from ya
305	20856	7	In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
305	20857	8	Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
305	20858	9	Free rent, living in my mind
305	20859	10	
305	20860	11	[Pre-Chorus]
305	20861	12	But then something happened one magical night
305	20862	13	[Chorus]
305	20863	14	I forgot that you existed
305	20864	15	And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
305	20865	16	And it was so nice
305	20866	17	So peaceful and quiet
305	20867	18	I forgot that you existed
305	20868	19	It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
305	20869	20	I forgot that you
305	20870	21	
305	20871	22	[Verse 2]
305	20872	23	Got out some popcorn
305	20873	24	As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
305	20874	25	Laughed on the school yard
305	20875	26	As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
305	20876	27	And I would've stuck around for ya
305	20877	28	Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
305	20878	29	Would've been right there, front row
305	20879	30	Even if nobody came to your show
305	20880	31	
305	20881	32	[Pre-Chorus]
305	20882	33	But you showed who you are, then one magical night
305	20883	34	
305	20884	35	[Chorus]
305	20885	36	I forgot that you existed
305	20886	37	And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
305	20887	38	And it was so nice
305	20888	39	So peaceful and quiet
305	20889	40	I forgot that you existed
305	20890	41	It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
305	20891	42	I forgot that you
305	20892	43	[Bridge]
305	20893	44	Sent me a clear message
305	20894	45	Taught me some hard lessons
305	20895	46	I just forget what they were
305	20896	47	It's all just a blur
305	20897	48	
305	20898	49	[Chorus]
305	20899	50	I forgot that you existed
305	20900	51	And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
305	20901	52	And it was so nice
305	20902	53	So peaceful and quiet
305	20903	54	I forgot that you existed
305	20904	55	I did, I did, I did

306	20570	2	(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
306	20571	3	
306	20572	4	[Verse 1]
306	20573	5	Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
306	20574	6	You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
306	20575	7	Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
306	20576	8	You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
306	20577	9	
306	20578	10	[Pre-Chorus]
306	20579	11	Killing me slow, out the window
306	20580	12	I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
306	20581	13	Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
306	20582	14	What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
306	20583	15	[Chorus]
306	20584	16	And it's new, the shape of your body
306	20585	17	It's blue, the feeling I've got
306	20586	18	And it's ooh, whoa-oh
306	20587	19	It's a cruel summer
306	20588	20	It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
306	20589	21	No rules in breakable heaven
306	20590	22	But ooh, whoa-oh
306	20591	23	It's a cruel summer with you
306	20592	24	
306	20593	25	[Verse 2]
306	20594	26	Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
306	20595	27	I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
306	20596	28	We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
306	20597	29	We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
306	20598	30	
306	20599	31	[Pre-Chorus]
306	20600	32	So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
306	20601	33	I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
306	20602	34	Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
306	20603	35	And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh
306	20604	36	
306	20605	37	[Chorus]
306	20606	38	It's new, the shape of your body

306	20613	45	It's a cruel summer with you
306	20614	46	[Bridge]
306	20615	47	I'm drunk in the back of the car
306	20616	48	And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
306	20617	49	Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
306	20618	50	I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
306	20619	51	And I snuck in through the garden gate
306	20620	52	Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
306	20621	53	And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
306	20622	54	I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
306	20623	55	He looks up, grinnin' like a devil
306	20624	56	
306	20625	57	[Chorus]
306	20626	58	It's new, the shape of your body
306	20627	59	It's blue, the feeling I've got

306	20629	61	It's a cruel summer
306	20630	62	It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
306	20631	63	No rules in breakable heaven
306	20632	64	But ooh, whoa-oh
306	20633	65	It's a cruel summer with you
306	20634	66	
306	20635	67	[Outro]
306	20636	68	I'm drunk in the back of the car
306	20637	69	And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
306	20638	70	Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
306	20639	71	I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
306	20640	72	And I snuck in through the garden gate
306	20641	73	Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
306	20642	74	And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
306	20643	75	I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
306	20644	76	(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)9
307	21098	1	[Verse 1]
307	21099	2	We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
307	21100	3	And this is our place, we make the rules
307	21101	4	And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
307	21102	5	Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
307	21103	6	[Chorus]
307	21104	7	Can I go where you go?
307	21105	8	Can we always be this close?
307	21106	9	Forever and ever, ah
307	21107	10	Take me out and take me home
307	21108	11	You're my, my, my, my lover
307	21109	12	[Verse 2]
307	21110	13	We could let our friends crash in the living room
307	21111	14	This is our place, we make the call
307	21112	15	And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
307	21113	16	I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
307	21114	17	[Chorus]
307	21115	18	Can I go where you go?
307	21116	19	Can we always be this close?
307	21117	20	Forever and ever, ah
307	21118	21	Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
307	21119	22	You're my, my, my, my lover
307	21120	23	
307	21121	24	[Bridge]
307	21122	25	Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
307	21123	26	With every guitar string scar on my hand
307	21124	27	I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
307	21125	28	My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
307	21126	29	All's well that ends well to end up with you
307	21127	30	Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
307	21128	31	And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
307	21129	32	And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover
307	21130	33	[Chorus]
307	21131	34	Can I go where you go?
307	21132	35	Can we always be this close?
307	21133	36	Forever and ever, ah
307	21134	37	Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
307	21135	38	You're my, my, my, my
307	21136	39	Oh, you're my, my, my, my
307	21137	40	Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover13
308	21494	1	[Verse 1]
308	21495	2	I would be complex, I would be cool
308	21496	3	They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
308	21497	4	And that would be okay for me to do
308	21498	5	Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you
308	21499	6	
308	21500	7	[Pre-Chorus]
308	21501	8	I’d be a fearless leader, I'd be an alpha type
308	21502	9	When everyone believes ya, what's that like?
308	21503	10	
308	21504	11	[Chorus]
308	21505	12	I’m so sick of running as fast as I can
308	21506	13	Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
308	21507	14	And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again
308	21508	15	'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
308	21509	16	I'd be the man (Man)
308	21510	17	I’d be the man (Man)
308	21511	18	[Verse 2]
308	21512	19	They’d say I hustled, put in the work
308	21513	20	They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
308	21514	21	What I was wearing, if I was rude
308	21515	22	Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
308	21516	23	
308	21517	24	[Pre-Chorus]
308	21518	25	And they would toast to me, oh (Ayy), let the players play
308	21519	26	I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez
308	21520	27	
308	21521	28	[Chorus]
308	21522	29	I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
308	21523	30	Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
308	21524	31	And I’m so sick of them comin' at me again
308	21525	32	'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
308	21526	33	I'd be the man (Man)
308	21527	34	I'd be the man (Man)
308	21528	35	
308	21529	36	[Bridge]
308	21530	37	What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
308	21531	38	And getting bitches and models?
308	21532	39	And it's all good if you're bad
308	21533	40	And it's okay if you're mad
308	21534	41	If I was out flashin' my dollars
308	21535	42	I'd be a bitch, not a baller
308	21536	43	They'd paint me out to be bad
308	21537	44	So it's okay that I'm mad
308	21538	45	[Chorus]
308	21539	46	I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
308	21540	47	Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
308	21541	48	And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again (Comin' at me again)
308	21542	49	'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)
308	21543	50	I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
308	21544	51	Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)
308	21545	52	And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again (Comin' at me again)
308	21546	53	'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man
308	21547	54	I'd be the man (Man)
308	21548	55	I'd be the man (Man, oh)
308	21549	56	I'd be the man (Man, yeah)
308	21550	57	I'd be the man (Man, I'd be the man)
308	21551	58	
308	21552	59	[Outro]
308	21553	60	If I was a man
308	21554	61	Then I'd be the man
309	21432	1	[Verse 1]
309	21433	2	Combat, I'm ready for combat
309	21434	3	I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
309	21435	4	'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
309	21436	5	I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you
309	21437	6	
309	21438	7	[Pre-Chorus]
309	21439	8	Easy they come, easy they go
309	21440	9	I jump from the train, I ride off alone
309	21441	10	I never grew up, it's getting so old
309	21442	11	Help me hold on to you
309	21443	12	[Chorus]
309	21444	13	I've been the archer, I've been the prey
309	21445	14	Who could ever leave me, darling
309	21446	15	But who could stay?
309	21447	16	
309	21448	17	[Verse 2]
309	21449	18	Dark side, I search for your dark side
309	21450	19	But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
309	21451	20	And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
309	21452	21	Then I hate my reflection for years and years
309	21453	22	
309	21454	23	[Pre-Chorus]
309	21455	24	I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
309	21456	25	The room is on fire, invisible smoke
309	21457	26	And all of my heroes die all alone
309	21458	27	Help me hold on to you
309	21459	28	
309	21460	29	[Chorus]
309	21461	30	I've been the archer, I've been the prey
309	21462	31	Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
309	21463	32	But who could stay?
309	21464	33	(I see right through me, I see right through me)
309	21465	34	
309	21466	35	[Bridge]
309	21467	36	'Cause they see right through me
309	21468	37	They see right through me
309	21469	38	They see right through
309	21470	39	Can you see right through me?
309	21471	40	They see right through
309	21472	41	They see right through me
309	21473	42	I see right through me
309	21474	43	I see right through me
309	21475	44	[Pre-Chorus]
309	21476	45	All the king's horses, all the king's men
309	21477	46	Couldn't put me together again
309	21478	47	'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
309	21479	48	Help me hold on to you
309	21480	49	
309	21481	50	[Chorus]
309	21482	51	I've been the archer, I've been the prey

309	21488	57	Who could stay?
309	21489	58	You could stay
309	21490	59	You could stay

309	21493	62	Combat, I'm ready for combat7
310	20908	1	[Verse 1]
310	20909	2	I think he knows
310	20910	3	His footprints on the sidewalk

310	20936	29	And he'll want me to stay
310	20937	30	I think he knows
310	20938	31	He'd better lock it down
310	20939	32	Or I won't stick around

311	21219	2	You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
311	21220	3	Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene
311	21221	4	Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
311	21222	5	I'm lost in the lights
311	21223	6	American glory faded before me
311	21224	7	Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
311	21225	8	Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
311	21226	9	And ran for my life (Ah)
311	21227	10	
311	21228	11	[Pre-Chorus]
311	21229	12	No cameras catch my pageant smile

311	21231	14	To see you there, to see you there
311	21232	15	It's been a long time coming, but

311	21244	27	My team is losing, battered and bruising

311	21246	29	Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
311	21247	30	Who seems to care
311	21248	31	American stories burning before me

312	21297	2	The moon is high
312	21298	3	Like your friends were the night that we first met
312	21299	4	Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
312	21300	5	Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
312	21301	6	The wine is cold
312	21302	7	Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
312	21303	8	Cat and mouse for a month or two or three

312	21322	27	In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
312	21323	28	When you jumped in first, I went in too
312	21324	29	I'm with you even if it makes me blue
312	21325	30	Which takes me back
312	21326	31	To the color that we painted your brother's wall

313	20502	1	[Verse 1]
313	20503	2	We were in the backseat
313	20504	3	Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
313	20505	4	"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
313	20506	5	I say casually in the car
313	20507	6	We were a fresh page on the desk
313	20508	7	Filling in the blanks as we go
313	20509	8	As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
313	20510	9	Leading us home
313	20511	10	
313	20512	11	[Chorus]
313	20513	12	And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends

313	20516	15	I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
313	20517	16	And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
313	20518	17	And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away

313	20520	19	I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
313	20521	20	[Verse 2]
313	20522	21	Windows flung right open, autumn air
313	20523	22	Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
313	20524	23	We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
313	20525	24	Memorize the creaks in the floor
313	20526	25	Back when we were card sharks, playing games
313	20527	26	I thought you were leading me on
313	20528	27	I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
313	20529	28	Before you even knew I was gone
313	20530	29	
313	20531	30	[Pre-Chorus]
313	20532	31	But then you called, showed your hand
313	20533	32	I turned around before I hit the tunnel
313	20534	33	Sat on the roof, you and I
313	20535	34	
313	20536	35	[Chorus]
313	20537	36	I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends

313	20545	44	[Bridge]
313	20546	45	You hold my hand on the street
313	20547	46	Walk me back to that apartment
313	20548	47	Years ago, we were just inside
313	20549	48	Barefoot in the kitchen
313	20550	49	Sacred new beginnings
313	20551	50	That became my religion, listen

314	20732	17	Even though we boarded them up
314	20733	18	Chandelier's still flickering here
314	20734	19	’Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not

314	20737	22	I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home

314	20739	24	They say, "I don't know"
314	20740	25	And what once was ours is no one's now
314	20741	26	I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
314	20742	27	Is this small town
314	20743	28	You said it was a great love, one for the ages
314	20744	29	But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?
314	20745	30

314	20759	44	Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
314	20760	45	Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
314	20761	46	Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
314	20762	47	Our songs, our films, united we stand
314	20763	48	Our country, guess it was a lawless land
314	20764	49	Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand

314	20766	51	My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
314	20767	52	Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
314	20768	53	Gave you too much, but it wasn't enough

316	21375	1	[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
316	21376	2	The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
316	21377	3	In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
316	21378	4	That was the first time we were there
316	21379	5	Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
316	21380	6	Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
316	21381	7	And I say to you...

316	21390	16	'Cause you have to
316	21391	17	[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
316	21392	18	I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
316	21393	19	You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
316	21394	20	I just pretend it isn't real
316	21395	21	I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
316	21396	22	I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
316	21397	23	And I say to you...
316	21398	24

316	21407	33	
316	21408	34	[Bridge: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]
316	21409	35	And I hate to make this all about me
316	21410	36	But who am I supposed to talk to?
316	21411	37	What am I supposed to do
316	21412	38	If there's no you?
316	21413	39	
316	21414	40	[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
316	21415	41	This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
316	21416	42	It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because
316	21417	43	'Cause I have to
316	21418	44	[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]
316	21419	45	Ooh-ah

316	21431	57	'Cause you have to
317	20789	1	[Verse 1]
317	20790	2	We were crazy to think
317	20791	3	Crazy to think that this could work
317	20792	4	Remember how I said I'd die for you?
317	20793	5	We were stupid to jump
317	20794	6	In the ocean separating us
317	20795	7	Remember how I’d fly to you?
317	20796	8	
317	20797	9	[Pre-Chorus]
317	20798	10	And I can't talk to you when you're like this
317	20799	11	Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town
317	20800	12	I'm New York City
317	20801	13	I still do it for you, babe
317	20802	14	They all warned us about times like this
317	20803	15	They say the road gets hard and you get lost
317	20804	16	When you're led by blind faith, blind faith
317	20805	17	[Chorus]
317	20806	18	But we might just get away with it
317	20807	19	Religion's in your lips
317	20808	20	Even if it's a false god
317	20809	21	We'd still worship
317	20810	22	We might just get away with it
317	20811	23	The altar is my hips
317	20812	24	Even if it's a false god
317	20813	25	We'd still worship this love
317	20814	26	We’d still worship this love
317	20815	27	We’d still worship this love
317	20816	28	
317	20817	29	[Verse 2]
317	20818	30	I know heaven's a thing
317	20819	31	I go there when you touch me, honey
317	20820	32	Hell is when I fight with you
317	20821	33	But we can patch it up good
317	20822	34	Make confessions and we’re begging for forgiveness
317	20823	35	Got the wine for you
317	20824	36	
317	20825	37	[Pre-Chorus]
317	20826	38	And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
317	20827	39	Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
317	20828	40	You're the West Village
317	20829	41	You still do it for me, babe
317	20830	42	They all warned us about times like this
317	20831	43	They say the road gets hard and you get lost
317	20832	44	When you’re led by blind faith, blind faith

317	20842	54	We'd still worship this love
317	20843	55	We'd still worship this love, ah

317	20845	57	[Outro]
317	20846	58	Still worship this love

317	20849	61	Still worship this love6
318	21555	1	[Verse 1]
318	21556	2	You are somebody that I don't know
318	21557	3	But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
318	21558	4	And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
318	21559	5	Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
318	21560	6	But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
318	21561	7	And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"
318	21562	8	
318	21563	9	[Pre-Chorus]
318	21564	10	And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
318	21565	11	But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
318	21566	12	And snakes and stones never broke my bones
318	21567	13	[Chorus]
318	21568	14	So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
318	21569	15	You need to calm down, you're being too loud
318	21570	16	And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
318	21571	17	You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
318	21572	18	You need to calm down
318	21573	19	
318	21574	20	[Verse 2]
318	21575	21	You are somebody that we don't know
318	21576	22	But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
318	21577	23	Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
318	21578	24	Sunshine on the street at the parade
318	21579	25	But you would rather be in the dark ages
318	21580	26	Makin' that sign must've taken all night
318	21581	27	
318	21582	28	[Pre-Chorus]
318	21583	29	You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
318	21584	30	And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
318	21585	31	'Cause shade never made anybody less gay
318	21586	32	
318	21587	33	[Chorus]
318	21588	34	So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
318	21589	35	You need to calm down, you're being too loud
318	21590	36	And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
318	21591	37	You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
318	21592	38	You need to calm down
318	21593	39	[Bridge]
318	21594	40	And we see you over there on the internet
318	21595	41	Comparing all the girls who are killing it
318	21596	42	But we figured you out
318	21597	43	We all know now we all got crowns
318	21598	44	You need to calm down
318	21599	45	
318	21600	46	[Chorus]
318	21601	47	Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
318	21602	48	You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
318	21603	49	You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
318	21604	50	And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
318	21605	51	You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
318	21606	52	Like can you just not step on our gowns?
318	21607	53	You need to calm down12
319	20441	1	[Verse 1]
319	20442	2	I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
319	20443	3	Put you in jail for something you didn’t do
319	20444	4	I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
319	20445	5	Thought I had reason to attack, but no
319	20446	6	
319	20447	7	[Pre-Chorus 1]
319	20448	8	Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
319	20449	9	Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there’s no us
319	20450	10	Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
319	20451	11	It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say
319	20452	12	[Chorus]
319	20453	13	Hey, it's all me, in my head
319	20454	14	I'm the one who burned us down
319	20455	15	But it's not what I meant
319	20456	16	Sorry that I hurt you
319	20457	17	I don't wanna do, I don’t wanna do this to you (Ooh)
319	20458	18	I don’t wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)

319	20461	21	
319	20462	22	[Verse 2]
319	20463	23	It's so excruciating to see you low
319	20464	24	Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
319	20465	25	This ultraviolet morning light below
319	20466	26	Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh
319	20467	27	
319	20468	28	[Pre-Chorus 2]
319	20469	29	I lived like an island, punished you with silence
319	20470	30	Went off like sirens, just crying
319	20471	31	Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
319	20472	32	It’s on your face, don't walk away, I need to say
319	20473	33

319	20485	45	Tell me that we'll be just fine
319	20486	46	Even when I lose my mind
319	20487	47	I need to say
319	20488	48	Tell me that it's not my fault
319	20489	49	Tell me that I'm all you want

321	20991	2	Ooh
321	20992	3	Ooh
321	20993	4	
321	20994	5	[Verse 1]
321	20995	6	School bell rings, walk me home
321	20996	7	Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
321	20997	8	Lost my gloves, you give me one
321	20998	9	"Wanna hang out?" Yeah, sounds like fun
321	20999	10	Video games, you pass me a note
321	21000	11	Sleeping in tents
321	21001	12	[Chorus]
321	21002	13	It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
321	21003	14	It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
321	21004	15	
321	21005	16	[Verse 2]
321	21006	17	Light pink sky, up on the roof
321	21007	18	Sun sinks down, no curfew
321	21008	19	20 questions, we tell the truth
321	21009	20	You've been stressed out lately, yeah, me too
321	21010	21	Something gave you the nerve
321	21011	22	To touch my hand
321	21012	23	
321	21013	24	[Chorus]
321	21014	25	It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
321	21015	26	It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
321	21016	27	
321	21017	28	[Instrumental bridge]
321	21018	29	
321	21019	30	[Verse 3]
321	21020	31	Church bells ring, carry me home
321	21021	32	Rice on the ground looks like snow
321	21022	33	Call my bluff, call you "Babe"
321	21023	34	Have my back, yeah, every day
321	21024	35	Feels like home, stay in bed
321	21025	36	The whole weekend
321	21026	37	[Chorus]
321	21027	38	It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
321	21028	39	It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
321	21029	40	It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
321	21030	41	(Ooh)
322	20645	1	[Verse 1]
322	20646	2	My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
322	20647	3	Everyone looked worse in the light
322	20648	4	There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
322	20649	5	I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye
322	20650	6	
322	20651	7	[Chorus]
322	20652	8	I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
322	20653	9	I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
322	20654	10	I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
322	20655	11	And now I see daylight, I only see daylight
322	20656	12	[Verse 2]
322	20657	13	Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
322	20658	14	And so I became the butt of the joke
322	20659	15	I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
322	20660	16	Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
322	20661	17	Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
322	20662	18	Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
322	20663	19	Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
322	20664	20	It's brighter now, now
322	20665	21	
322	20666	22	[Chorus]
322	20667	23	I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
322	20668	24	(I can never look away)
322	20669	25	I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
322	20670	26	(Things will never be the same)
322	20671	27	I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
322	20672	28	(Now I'm wide awake)
322	20673	29	And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)
322	20674	30	I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
322	20675	31	I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
322	20676	32	
322	20677	33	[Bridge]
322	20678	34	And I can still see it all (In my mind)
322	20679	35	All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
322	20680	36	I once believed love would be (Black and white)
322	20681	37	But it's golden (Golden)
322	20682	38	And I can still see it all (In my head)
322	20683	39	Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
322	20684	40	I once believed love would be (Burning red)
322	20685	41	But it's golden
322	20686	42	Like daylight, like daylight
322	20687	43	Like daylight, daylight
322	20688	44	[Chorus]
322	20689	45	I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
322	20690	46	(I can never look away)
322	20691	47	And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
322	20692	48	(Things will never be the same)
322	20693	49	I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
322	20694	50	(Now I'm wide awake)
322	20695	51	And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)
322	20696	52	I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
322	20697	53	I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
322	20698	54	(And I can still see it all)
322	20699	55	I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
322	20700	56	(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
322	20701	57	I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
322	20702	58	(I once believed love would be burning red)
322	20703	59	
322	20704	60	[Outro]
322	20705	61	Like daylight
322	20706	62	It's golden like daylight
322	20707	63	You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
322	20708	64	Just let it go, let it go
322	20709	65	[Spoken Outro]
322	20710	66	I wanna be defined by the things that I love
322	20711	67	Not the things I hate
322	20712	68	Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
322	20713	69	Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
322	20714	70	I, I just think that
322	20715	71	You are what you love
343	23110	1	[Verse 1]
343	23111	2	When the morning came
343	23112	3	We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
343	23113	4	'Cause we lost track of time again
343	23114	5	Laughing with my feet in your lap
343	23115	6	Like you were my closest friend
343	23116	7	"How'd we end up on the floor, anyway?" you say
343	23117	8	"Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how"
343	23118	9	I see you every day now
343	23119	10	
343	23120	11	[Chorus]
343	23121	12	And I chose you
343	23122	13	The one I was dancing with
343	23123	14	In New York, no shoes
343	23124	15	Looked up at the sky and it was
343	23125	16	The burgundy on my t-shirt
343	23126	17	When you splashed your wine into me
343	23127	18	And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
343	23128	19	So scarlet, it was
343	23129	20	The mark thеy saw on my collarbone
343	23130	21	The rust that grew bеtween telephones
343	23131	22	The lips I used to call home
343	23132	23	So scarlet, it was maroon
343	23133	24	[Verse 2]
343	23134	25	When the silence came
343	23135	26	We were shaking, blind and hazy
343	23136	27	How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
343	23137	28	Sobbing with your head in your hands
343	23138	29	Ain't that the way shit always ends?
343	23139	30	You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
343	23140	31	Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us
343	23141	32	I feel you, no matter what
343	23142	33	The rubies that I gave up
343	23143	34	
343	23144	35	[Chorus]
343	23145	36	And I lost you
343	23146	37	The one I was dancing with
343	23147	38	In New York, no shoes
343	23148	39	Looked up at the sky and it was (Maroon)
343	23149	40	The burgundy on my t-shirt
343	23150	41	When you splashed your wine into me
343	23151	42	And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
343	23152	43	So scarlet, it was (Maroon)
343	23153	44	The mark they saw on my collarbone
343	23154	45	The rust that grew between telephones
343	23155	46	The lips I used to call home
343	23156	47	So scarlet, it was maroon
343	23157	48	
343	23158	49	[Bridge]
343	23159	50	And I wake with your memory over me
343	23160	51	That's a real fucking legacy, legacy (It was maroon)
343	23161	52	And I wake with your memory over me
343	23162	53	That's a real fucking legacy to leave
343	23163	54	[Chorus]
343	23164	55	The burgundy on my t-shirt
343	23165	56	When you splashed your wine into me
343	23166	57	And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
343	23167	58	So scarlet, it was maroon
343	23168	59	The mark they saw on my collarbone
343	23169	60	The rust that grew between telephones
343	23170	61	The lips I used to call home
343	23171	62	So scarlet, it was maroon
343	23172	63	
343	23173	64	[Outro]
343	23174	65	It was maroon
343	23175	66	It was maroon
344	22778	1	[Verse 1]
344	22779	2	I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
344	22780	3	Midnights become my afternoons
344	22781	4	When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
344	22782	5	I've ghosted stand there in the room
344	22783	6	
344	22784	7	[Pre-Chorus]
344	22785	8	I should not be left to my own devices
344	22786	9	They come with prices and vices
344	22787	10	I end up in crisis
344	22788	11	(Tale as old as time)
344	22789	12	I wake up screaming from dreaming
344	22790	13	One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
344	22791	14	'Cause you got tired of my scheming
344	22792	15	(For the last time)
344	22793	16	[Chorus]
344	22794	17	It's me, hi
344	22795	18	I'm the problem, it's me
344	22796	19	At teatime, everybody agrees
344	22797	20	I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
344	22798	21	It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
344	22799	22	
344	22800	23	[Verse 2]
344	22801	24	Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
344	22802	25	And I'm a monster on the hill
344	22803	26	Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
344	22804	27	Pierced through the heart, but never killed
344	22805	28	
344	22806	29	[Pre-Chorus]
344	22807	30	Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
344	22808	31	Like some kind of congressman?
344	22809	32	(A tale as old as time)
344	22810	33	I wake up screaming from dreaming
344	22811	34	One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
344	22812	35	And life will lose all its meaning
344	22813	36	(For the last time)
344	22814	37	
344	22815	38	[Chorus]
344	22816	39	It's me, hi
344	22817	40	I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
344	22818	41	At teatime, everybody agrees
344	22819	42	I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
344	22820	43	It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
344	22821	44	[Bridge]
344	22822	45	I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
344	22823	46	She thinks I left them in the will
344	22824	47	The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
344	22825	48	"She's laughing up at us from Hell"
344	22826	49	
344	22827	50	[Breakdown]
344	22828	51	It's me, hi
344	22829	52	I'm the problem, it's me
344	22830	53	It's me, hi
344	22831	54	I'm the problem, it's me
344	22832	55	It's me, hi
344	22833	56	Everybody agrees, everybody agrees
344	22834	57	
344	22835	58	[Chorus]
344	22836	59	It's me, hi (Hi)
344	22837	60	I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
344	22838	61	At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
344	22839	62	I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
344	22840	63	It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
346	23549	1	[Verse 1]
346	23550	2	Summer went away, still, the yearning stays
346	23551	3	I play it cool with the best of them
346	23552	4	I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me
346	23553	5	It's okay, we're the best of friends
346	23554	6	Anyway
346	23555	7	I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
346	23556	8	I touch my phone as if it's your face
346	23557	9	I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
346	23558	10	There's just one who could make me stay
346	23559	11	All my days
346	23560	12	[Pre-Chorus]
346	23561	13	From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
346	23562	14	I waited ages to see you there
346	23563	15	I search the party of better bodies
346	23564	16	Just to learn that you never cared
346	23565	17	
346	23566	18	[Chorus]
346	23567	19	You're on your own, kid
346	23568	20	You always have been
346	23569	21	
346	23570	22	[Verse 2]
346	23571	23	I see the great escape, so long, Daisy May
346	23572	24	I picked the petals, he loves me not
346	23573	25	Something different bloomed, writing in my room
346	23574	26	I play my songs in the parking lot
346	23575	27	I'll run away
346	23576	28	
346	23577	29	[Pre-Chorus]
346	23578	30	From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
346	23579	31	I called a taxi to take me there
346	23580	32	I search the party of better bodies
346	23581	33	Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare
346	23582	34	
346	23583	35	[Chorus]
346	23584	36	You're on your own, kid
346	23585	37	You always have been
346	23586	38	[Instrumental Break]
346	23587	39	
346	23588	40	[Bridge]
346	23589	41	From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
346	23590	42	I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
346	23591	43	I hosted parties and starved my body
346	23592	44	Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
346	23593	45	The jokes weren't funny, I took the money
346	23594	46	My friends from home don't know what to say
346	23595	47	I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
346	23596	48	And I saw something they can't take away
346	23597	49	'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
346	23598	50	Everything you lose is a step you take
346	23599	51	So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
346	23600	52	You've got no reason to be afraid
346	23601	53	
346	23602	54	[Chorus]
346	23603	55	You're on your own, kid
346	23604	56	Yeah, you can face this
346	23605	57	You're on your own, kid
346	23606	58	You always have been
347	23242	1	[Intro]
347	23243	2	Rain
347	23244	3	He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
347	23245	4	He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
347	23246	5	Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
347	23247	6	All of me changed like midnight
347	23248	7	
347	23249	8	[Verse 1]
347	23250	9	My town was a wasteland
347	23251	10	Full of cages, full of fences
347	23252	11	Pageant queens and big pretenders
347	23253	12	But for some, it was paradise
347	23254	13	My boy was a montage
347	23255	14	A slow-motion, love potion
347	23256	15	Jumping off things in the ocean
347	23257	16	I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
347	23258	17	He was sunshine, I was midnight rain
347	23259	18	[Chorus]
347	23260	19	He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
347	23261	20	He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
347	23262	21	Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
347	23263	22	All of me changed like midnight
347	23264	23	
347	23265	24	[Verse 2]
347	23266	25	It came like a postcard
347	23267	26	Picture perfect shiny family
347	23268	27	Holiday peppermint candy
347	23269	28	But for him, it's every day
347	23270	29	So I peered through a window
347	23271	30	A deep portal, time travel
347	23272	31	All the love we unravel
347	23273	32	And the life I gave away
347	23274	33	'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain
347	23275	34	
347	23276	35	[Chorus]
347	23277	36	He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
347	23278	37	He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
347	23279	38	Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
347	23280	39	All of me changed like midnight rain
347	23281	40	He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
347	23282	41	He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
347	23283	42	Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
347	23284	43	All of me changed like midnight
347	23285	44	[Outro]
347	23286	45	I guess sometimes we all get
347	23287	46	Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
347	23288	47	And he never thinks of me
347	23289	48	Except for when I'm on TV
347	23290	49	I guess sometimes we all get
347	23291	50	Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
347	23292	51	And I never think of him
347	23293	52	Except on midnights like this
347	23294	53	(Midnights like this, midnights like this)2
348	23295	1	[Intro]
348	23296	2	I remember
348	23297	3	
348	23298	4	[Verse 1]
348	23299	5	Good girl, sad boy
348	23300	6	Big city, wrong choices
348	23301	7	We had one thing goin' on
348	23302	8	I swear that it was somethin'
348	23303	9	'Cause I don't remember who I was
348	23304	10	Before you painted all my nights
348	23305	11	A color I've searched for since
348	23306	12	But one thing after another
348	23307	13	Fuckin' situations, circumstances
348	23308	14	Miscommunications, and I
348	23309	15	Have to say, by the way
348	23310	16	I just may like some explanations
348	23311	17	[Chorus]
348	23312	18	Can I ask you a question?
348	23313	19	Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
348	23314	20	And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
348	23315	21	But fifteen seconds later, thеy were clappin' too?
348	23316	22	Then what did you do?
348	23317	23	Did you lеave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
348	23318	24	Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
348	23319	25	When she said it was too much?
348	23320	26	Do you wish you could still touch her?
348	23321	27	It's just a question
348	23322	28	
348	23323	29	[Verse 2]
348	23324	30	Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
348	23325	31	Did you realize out of time?
348	23326	32	She was on your mind with some dickhead guy
348	23327	33	That you saw that night
348	23328	34	But you were on somethin'
348	23329	35	It was one drink after another
348	23330	36	Fuckin' politics and gender roles
348	23331	37	And you're not sure and I don't know
348	23332	38	Got swept away in the gray
348	23333	39	I just may like to have a conversation
348	23334	40	
348	23335	41	[Chorus]
348	23336	42	Can I ask you a question?
348	23337	43	Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
348	23338	44	And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
348	23339	45	But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?
348	23340	46	Then what did you do?
348	23341	47	Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
348	23342	48	Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
348	23343	49	When she said it was too much?
348	23344	50	Do you wish you could still touch her?
348	23345	51	It's just a question
348	23346	52	[Bridge]
348	23347	53	Does it feel like everything's just like
348	23348	54	Second best after that meteor strike?
348	23349	55	And what's that that I heard? That you're still with her?
348	23350	56	That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable
348	23351	57	And right, but tonight
348	23352	58	
348	23353	59	[Chorus]
348	23354	60	Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?)
348	23355	61	Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room (In a crowded room)
348	23356	62	And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you (Makin' fun of you)
348	23357	63	But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?
348	23358	64	Then what did you do? (Do)
348	23359	65	Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
348	23360	66	Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh (More of a fight)
348	23361	67	When she said it was too much?
348	23362	68	Do you wish you could still touch her?
348	23363	69	It's just a question2
349	23500	1	[Verse 1]
349	23501	2	Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
349	23502	3	You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them
349	23503	4	Sometimes I wonder which one'll be your last lie
349	23504	5	They say looks can kill and I might try
349	23505	6	I don't dress for women
349	23506	7	I don't dress for men
349	23507	8	Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge
349	23508	9	
349	23509	10	[Chorus]
349	23510	11	I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
349	23511	12	Don't get sad, get even
349	23512	13	So on the weekends
349	23513	14	I don't dress for friends
349	23514	15	Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge
349	23515	16	[Verse 2]
349	23516	17	She needed cold, hard proof, so I gave her some
349	23517	18	She had the envelope, where you think she got it from?
349	23518	19	Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride
349	23519	20	Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife
349	23520	21	And she looks so pretty
349	23521	22	Drivin' in your Benz
349	23522	23	Lately, she's been dressin' for revenge
349	23523	24	
349	23524	25	[Chorus]
349	23525	26	She don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ends
349	23526	27	Don't get sad, get even
349	23527	28	So on the weekends
349	23528	29	She don't dress for friends
349	23529	30	Lately, she's been dressing for revenge
349	23530	31	
349	23531	32	[Bridge]
349	23532	33	Ladies always rise above
349	23533	34	Ladies know what people want
349	23534	35	Someone sweet and kind and fun
349	23535	36	The lady simply had enough
349	23536	37	
349	23537	38	[Verse 3]
349	23538	39	While he was doin' lines and crossin' all of mine
349	23539	40	Someone told his white-collar crimes to the FBI
349	23540	41	And I don't dress for villains
349	23541	42	Or for innocents
349	23542	43	I'm on my vigilante shit again
349	23543	44	[Chorus]
349	23544	45	I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
349	23545	46	Don't get sad, get even
349	23546	47	So on the weekends
349	23547	48	I don't dress for friends
349	23548	49	Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge3
350	22841	1	[Verse 1]
350	22842	2	Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
350	22843	3	Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind
350	22844	4	In the shoes I gave you as a present
350	22845	5	Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
350	22846	6	And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight
350	22847	7	
350	22848	8	[Chorus]
350	22849	9	Best believe I'm still bejeweled
350	22850	10	When I walk in the room
350	22851	11	I can still make the whole place shimmer
350	22852	12	And when I meet the band
350	22853	13	They ask, "Do you have a man?"
350	22854	14	I could still say, "I don't remember"
350	22855	15	Familiarity breeds contempt
350	22856	16	Don't put mе in the basement
350	22857	17	Whеn I want the penthouse of your heart
350	22858	18	Diamonds in my eyes
350	22859	19	I polish up real, I polish up real nice
350	22860	20	[Post-Chorus]
350	22861	21	Nice
350	22862	22	
350	22863	23	[Verse 2]
350	22864	24	Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl (Too good of a girl)
350	22865	25	Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
350	22866	26	I think it's time to teach some lessons
350	22867	27	I made you my world (Huh), have you heard? (Huh)
350	22868	28	I can reclaim the land
350	22869	29	And I miss you (Miss you), but I miss sparklin' (Nice)
350	22870	30	
350	22871	31	[Chorus]
350	22872	32	Best believe I'm still bejeweled
350	22873	33	When I walk in the room
350	22874	34	I can still make the whole place shimmer
350	22875	35	And when I meet the band

350	22881	41	Diamonds in my eyes
350	22882	42	I polish up real, I polish up real nice
350	22883	43	
350	22884	44	[Post-Chorus]
350	22885	45	Nice
350	22886	46	[Bridge]
350	22887	47	Sapphire tears on my face
350	22888	48	Sadness became my whole sky
350	22889	49	But some guy said my aura's moonstone
350	22890	50	Just 'cause he was high
350	22891	51	And we're dancin' all night
350	22892	52	And you can try to change my mind
350	22893	53	But you might have to wait in line
350	22894	54	What's a girl gonna do?
350	22895	55	A diamond's gotta shine
350	22896	56	
350	22897	57	[Chorus]
350	22898	58	Best believe I'm still bejeweled
350	22899	59	When I walk in the room
350	22900	60	I can still make the whole place shimmer (Shimmer)
350	22901	61	And when I meet the band
350	22902	62	They ask, "Do you have a man?"
350	22903	63	I could still say, "I don't remember"

350	22907	67	Diamonds in my eyes
350	22908	68	I polish up real (Nice), I polish up real nice
350	22909	69	
350	22910	70	[Outro]
350	22911	71	And we're dancin' all night
350	22912	72	And you can try to change my mind
350	22913	73	But you might have to wait in line
350	22914	74	What's a girl gonna do? What's a girl gonna do?
350	22915	75	I polish up nice
350	22916	76	Best believe I'm still bejeweled
350	22917	77	When I walk in the room
350	22918	78	I can still make the whole place shimmer2
351	22995	1	[Verse 1]
351	22996	2	"It only hurts this much right now"
351	22997	3	Was what I was thinkin' the whole time
351	22998	4	Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out
351	22999	5	I'll be gettin' over you my whole life
351	23000	6	
351	23001	7	[Pre-Chorus]
351	23002	8	You know how scared I am of elevators
351	23003	9	Never trust it if it rises fast
351	23004	10	It can't last
351	23005	11	[Chorus]
351	23006	12	Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
351	23007	13	Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
351	23008	14	Oh, I'm fallin' in love
351	23009	15	I thought the plane was goin' down
351	23010	16	How'd you turn it right around?
351	23011	17	
351	23012	18	[Verse 2]
351	23013	19	It only feels this raw right now
351	23014	20	Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
351	23015	21	Break up, break free, break through, break down
351	23016	22	You would break your back to make me break a smile
351	23017	23	
351	23018	24	[Pre-Chorus]
351	23019	25	You know how much I hate
351	23020	26	That everybody just expects me to bounce back
351	23021	27	Just like that
351	23022	28	
351	23023	29	[Chorus]
351	23024	30	Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
351	23025	31	Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
351	23026	32	Oh, I'm fallin' in love
351	23027	33	I thought the plane was goin' down
351	23028	34	How'd you turn it right around?
351	23029	35	Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
351	23030	36	Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
351	23031	37	Oh, I'm fallin' in love
351	23032	38	I thought the plane was goin' down
351	23033	39	How'd you turn it right around?
351	23034	40	Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
351	23035	41	Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
351	23036	42	Oh, I'm fallin' in love
351	23037	43	I thought the plane was goin' down

351	23040	46	Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
351	23041	47	Oh, I'm fallin' in love
351	23042	48	I thought the plane was goin' down
351	23043	49	How'd you turn it right around?
353	23449	1	[Verse 1]
353	23450	2	I spy with my little tired eye
353	23451	3	Tiny as a firefly
353	23452	4	A pebble that we picked up last July
353	23453	5	Down deep inside your pocket
353	23454	6	We almost forgot it
353	23455	7	Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
353	23456	8	Ooh, ooh
353	23457	9	
353	23458	10	[Chorus]
353	23459	11	They said the end is comin'
353	23460	12	Everyone’s up to somethin'
353	23461	13	I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
353	23462	14	Outside, they’re push and shovin'
353	23463	15	You're in the kitchen hummin'
353	23464	16	All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'
353	23465	17	[Verse 2]
353	23466	18	On the way home
353	23467	19	I wrote a poem
353	23468	20	You say, "What a mind"
353	23469	21	This happens all the time
353	23470	22	Ooh, ooh
353	23471	23	
353	23472	24	[Chorus]
353	23473	25	'Causе they said the end is comin'
353	23474	26	Evеryone's up to somethin’
353	23475	27	I find myself runnin’ home to your sweet nothings
353	23476	28	Outside, they're push and shovin’
353	23477	29	You're in the kitchen hummin'
353	23478	30	All that you ever wanted from me was nothin'
353	23479	31	
353	23480	32	[Bridge]
353	23481	33	Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
353	23482	34	And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
353	23483	35	And the voices that implore, "You should be doing more"
353	23484	36	To you, I can admit that I’m just too soft for all of it
353	23485	37	Ooh
353	23486	38	
353	23487	39	[Chorus]
353	23488	40	They said the end is comin'
353	23489	41	Everyone's up to somethin'
353	23490	42	I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
353	23491	43	Outside, they're push and shovin'
353	23492	44	You're in the kitchen hummin'
353	23493	45	All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'
353	23494	46	They said the end is comin' (They said the end is comin')
353	23495	47	Everyone's up to somethin' (Everyone's up to somethin')
353	23496	48	I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
353	23497	49	Outside, they're push and shovin' (Outside, they're push and shovin')
353	23498	50	You're in the kitchen hummin' (You're in the kitchen hummin')
353	23499	51	All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'2
354	23176	1	[Verse 1]
354	23177	2	Once upon a time, the planets and the fates
354	23178	3	And all the stars aligned
354	23179	4	You and I ended up in the same room
354	23180	5	At the same time
354	23181	6	
354	23182	7	[Pre-Chorus]
354	23183	8	And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
354	23184	9	Of a chain reaction of countermoves
354	23185	10	To assess the equation of you
354	23186	11	Checkmate, I couldn't lose
354	23187	12	[Chorus]
354	23188	13	What if I told you none of it was accidental?
354	23189	14	And the first night that you saw me
354	23190	15	Nothing was gonna stop me
354	23191	16	I laid the groundwork, and then
354	23192	17	Just like clockwork
354	23193	18	The dominoes cascaded in a line
354	23194	19	What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
354	23195	20	And now you're mine
354	23196	21	It was all by dеsign
354	23197	22	'Cause I'm a mastermind
354	23198	23	
354	23199	24	[Verse 2]
354	23200	25	You see, all the wisеst women
354	23201	26	Had to do it this way
354	23202	27	'Cause we were born to be the pawn
354	23203	28	In every lover's game
354	23204	29	
354	23205	30	[Pre-Chorus]
354	23206	31	If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
354	23207	32	Strategy sets the scene for the tale
354	23208	33	I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
354	23209	34	And the liquor in our cocktails
354	23210	35	
354	23211	36	[Chorus]
354	23212	37	What if I told you none of it was accidental?
354	23213	38	And the first night that you saw me
354	23214	39	I knew I wanted your body
354	23215	40	I laid the groundwork, and then
354	23216	41	Just like clockwork
354	23217	42	The dominoes cascaded in a line
354	23218	43	What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
354	23219	44	And now you're mine
354	23220	45	It was all my design
354	23221	46	'Cause I'm a mastermind
354	23222	47	[Bridge]
354	23223	48	No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
354	23224	49	So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since
354	23225	50	To make them love me and make it seem effortless
354	23226	51	This is the first time I've felt the need to confess
354	23227	52	And I swear
354	23228	53	I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian
354	23229	54	'Cause I care
354	23230	55	
354	23231	56	[Chorus]
354	23232	57	So I told you none of it was accidental
354	23233	58	And the first night that you saw me
354	23234	59	Nothing was gonna stop me
354	23235	60	I laid the groundwork, and then
354	23236	61	Saw a wide smirk on your face
354	23237	62	You knew the entire time
354	23238	63	You knew that I'm a mastermind
354	23239	64	And now you're mine
354	23240	65	Yeah, all you did was smile
354	23241	66	'Cause I'm a mastermind2
356	24151	1	[Verse 1]
356	24152	2	When the morning came
356	24153	3	We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
356	24154	4	'Cause we lost track of time again
356	24155	5	Laughing with my feet in your lap
356	24156	6	Like you were my closest friend
356	24157	7	"How'd we end up on the floor, anyway?" you say
356	24158	8	"Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how"
356	24159	9	I see you every day now
356	24160	10	
356	24161	11	[Chorus]
356	24162	12	And I chose you
356	24163	13	The one I was dancing with
356	24164	14	In New York, no shoes
356	24165	15	Looked up at the sky and it was
356	24166	16	The burgundy on my t-shirt
356	24167	17	When you splashed your wine into me
356	24168	18	And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
356	24169	19	So scarlet, it was
356	24170	20	The mark thеy saw on my collarbone
356	24171	21	The rust that grew bеtween telephones
356	24172	22	The lips I used to call home
356	24173	23	So scarlet, it was maroon
356	24174	24	[Verse 2]
356	24175	25	When the silence came
356	24176	26	We were shaking, blind and hazy
356	24177	27	How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
356	24178	28	Sobbing with your head in your hands
356	24179	29	Ain't that the way shit always ends?
356	24180	30	You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
356	24181	31	Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us
356	24182	32	I feel you, no matter what
356	24183	33	The rubies that I gave up
356	24184	34	
356	24185	35	[Chorus]
356	24186	36	And I lost you
356	24187	37	The one I was dancing with
356	24188	38	In New York, no shoes
356	24189	39	Looked up at the sky and it was (Maroon)
356	24190	40	The burgundy on my t-shirt
356	24191	41	When you splashed your wine into me
356	24192	42	And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
356	24193	43	So scarlet, it was (Maroon)
356	24194	44	The mark they saw on my collarbone
356	24195	45	The rust that grew between telephones
356	24196	46	The lips I used to call home
356	24197	47	So scarlet, it was maroon
356	24198	48	
356	24199	49	[Bridge]
356	24200	50	And I wake with your memory over me
356	24201	51	That's a real fucking legacy, legacy (It was maroon)
356	24202	52	And I wake with your memory over me
356	24203	53	That's a real fucking legacy to leave
356	24204	54	[Chorus]
356	24205	55	The burgundy on my t-shirt
356	24206	56	When you splashed your wine into me
356	24207	57	And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
356	24208	58	So scarlet, it was maroon
356	24209	59	The mark they saw on my collarbone
356	24210	60	The rust that grew between telephones
356	24211	61	The lips I used to call home
356	24212	62	So scarlet, it was maroon
356	24213	63	
356	24214	64	[Outro]
356	24215	65	It was maroon
356	24216	66	It was maroon
360	24283	1	[Intro]
360	24284	2	Rain
360	24285	3	He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
360	24286	4	He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
360	24287	5	Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
360	24288	6	All of me changed like midnight
360	24289	7	
360	24290	8	[Verse 1]
360	24291	9	My town was a wasteland
360	24292	10	Full of cages, full of fences
360	24293	11	Pageant queens and big pretenders
360	24294	12	But for some, it was paradise
360	24295	13	My boy was a montage
360	24296	14	A slow-motion, love potion
360	24297	15	Jumping off things in the ocean
360	24298	16	I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
360	24299	17	He was sunshine, I was midnight rain
360	24300	18	[Chorus]
360	24301	19	He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
360	24302	20	He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
360	24303	21	Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
360	24304	22	All of me changed like midnight
360	24305	23	
360	24306	24	[Verse 2]
360	24307	25	It came like a postcard
360	24308	26	Picture perfect shiny family
360	24309	27	Holiday peppermint candy
360	24310	28	But for him, it's every day
360	24311	29	So I peered through a window
360	24312	30	A deep portal, time travel
360	24313	31	All the love we unravel
360	24314	32	And the life I gave away
360	24315	33	'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain
360	24316	34	
360	24317	35	[Chorus]
360	24318	36	He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
360	24319	37	He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
360	24320	38	Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
360	24321	39	All of me changed like midnight rain
360	24322	40	He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
360	24323	41	He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
360	24324	42	Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
360	24325	43	All of me changed like midnight
360	24326	44	[Outro]
360	24327	45	I guess sometimes we all get
360	24328	46	Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
360	24329	47	And he never thinks of me
360	24330	48	Except for when I'm on TV
360	24331	49	I guess sometimes we all get
360	24332	50	Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
360	24333	51	And I never think of him
360	24334	52	Except on midnights like this
360	24335	53	(Midnights like this, midnights like this)2
362	24681	1	[Verse 1]
362	24682	2	Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
362	24683	3	You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them
362	24684	4	Sometimes I wonder which one'll be your last lie
362	24685	5	They say looks can kill and I might try
362	24686	6	I don't dress for women
362	24687	7	I don't dress for men
362	24688	8	Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge
362	24689	9	
362	24690	10	[Chorus]
362	24691	11	I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
362	24692	12	Don't get sad, get even
362	24693	13	So on the weekends
362	24694	14	I don't dress for friends
362	24695	15	Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge
362	24696	16	[Verse 2]
362	24697	17	She needed cold, hard proof, so I gave her some
362	24698	18	She had the envelope, where you think she got it from?
362	24699	19	Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride
362	24700	20	Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife
362	24701	21	And she looks so pretty
362	24702	22	Drivin' in your Benz
362	24703	23	Lately, she's been dressin' for revenge
362	24704	24	
362	24705	25	[Chorus]
362	24706	26	She don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ends
362	24707	27	Don't get sad, get even
362	24708	28	So on the weekends
362	24709	29	She don't dress for friends
362	24710	30	Lately, she's been dressing for revenge
362	24711	31	
362	24712	32	[Bridge]
362	24713	33	Ladies always rise above
362	24714	34	Ladies know what people want
362	24715	35	Someone sweet and kind and fun
362	24716	36	The lady simply had enough
362	24717	37	
362	24718	38	[Verse 3]
362	24719	39	While he was doin' lines and crossin' all of mine
362	24720	40	Someone told his white-collar crimes to the FBI
362	24721	41	And I don't dress for villains
362	24722	42	Or for innocents
362	24723	43	I'm on my vigilante shit again
362	24724	44	[Chorus]
362	24725	45	I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
362	24726	46	Don't get sad, get even
362	24727	47	So on the weekends
362	24728	48	I don't dress for friends
362	24729	49	Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge3
363	23670	1	[Verse 1]
363	23671	2	Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
363	23672	3	Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind
363	23673	4	In the shoes I gave you as a present
363	23674	5	Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
363	23675	6	And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight
363	23676	7	
363	23677	8	[Chorus]
363	23678	9	Best believe I'm still bejeweled
363	23679	10	When I walk in the room
363	23680	11	I can still make the whole place shimmer
363	23681	12	And when I meet the band
363	23682	13	They ask, "Do you have a man?"
363	23683	14	I could still say, "I don't remember"
363	23684	15	Familiarity breeds contempt
363	23685	16	Don't put mе in the basement
363	23686	17	Whеn I want the penthouse of your heart
363	23687	18	Diamonds in my eyes
363	23688	19	I polish up real, I polish up real nice
363	23689	20	[Post-Chorus]
363	23690	21	Nice

363	23693	24	Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl (Too good of a girl)
363	23694	25	Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
363	23695	26	I think it's time to teach some lessons
363	23696	27	I made you my world (Huh), have you heard? (Huh)
363	23697	28	I can reclaim the land
363	23698	29	And I miss you (Miss you), but I miss sparklin' (Nice)

363	23714	45	Nice
363	23715	46	[Bridge]
363	23716	47	Sapphire tears on my face
363	23717	48	Sadness became my whole sky
363	23718	49	But some guy said my aura's moonstone
363	23719	50	Just 'cause he was high
363	23720	51	And we're dancin' all night
363	23721	52	And you can try to change my mind
363	23722	53	But you might have to wait in line
363	23723	54	What's a girl gonna do?
363	23724	55	A diamond's gotta shine

364	24037	2	"It only hurts this much right now"
364	24038	3	Was what I was thinkin' the whole time
364	24039	4	Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out

364	24053	18	[Verse 2]
364	24054	19	It only feels this raw right now
364	24055	20	Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
364	24056	21	Break up, break free, break through, break down
364	24057	22	You would break your back to make me break a smile

366	24559	2	I spy with my little tired eye
366	24560	3	Tiny as a firefly
366	24561	4	A pebble that we picked up last July
366	24562	5	Down deep inside your pocket
366	24563	6	We almost forgot it
366	24564	7	Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
366	24565	8	Ooh, ooh

366	24567	10	[Chorus]
366	24568	11	They said the end is comin'

366	24572	15	You're in the kitchen hummin'
366	24573	16	All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'
366	24574	17	[Verse 2]
366	24575	18	On the way home
366	24576	19	I wrote a poem
366	24577	20	You say, "What a mind"
366	24578	21	This happens all the time
366	24579	22	Ooh, ooh

366	24589	32	[Bridge]
366	24590	33	Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
366	24591	34	And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
366	24592	35	And the voices that implore, "You should be doing more"
366	24593	36	To you, I can admit that I’m just too soft for all of it
366	24594	37	Ooh
366	24595	38

366	24600	43	Outside, they're push and shovin'
366	24601	44	You're in the kitchen hummin'
366	24602	45	All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'
366	24603	46	They said the end is comin' (They said the end is comin')
366	24604	47	Everyone's up to somethin' (Everyone's up to somethin')
366	24605	48	I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
366	24606	49	Outside, they're push and shovin' (Outside, they're push and shovin')
366	24607	50	You're in the kitchen hummin' (You're in the kitchen hummin')
366	24608	51	All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'2
367	24217	1	[Verse 1]
367	24218	2	Once upon a time, the planets and the fates
367	24219	3	And all the stars aligned
367	24220	4	You and I ended up in the same room
367	24221	5	At the same time
367	24222	6	
367	24223	7	[Pre-Chorus]
367	24224	8	And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
367	24225	9	Of a chain reaction of countermoves
367	24226	10	To assess the equation of you
367	24227	11	Checkmate, I couldn't lose
367	24228	12	[Chorus]
367	24229	13	What if I told you none of it was accidental?
367	24230	14	And the first night that you saw me
367	24231	15	Nothing was gonna stop me
367	24232	16	I laid the groundwork, and then
367	24233	17	Just like clockwork
367	24234	18	The dominoes cascaded in a line
367	24235	19	What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
367	24236	20	And now you're mine
367	24237	21	It was all by dеsign
367	24238	22	'Cause I'm a mastermind
367	24239	23	
367	24240	24	[Verse 2]
367	24241	25	You see, all the wisеst women
367	24242	26	Had to do it this way
367	24243	27	'Cause we were born to be the pawn
367	24244	28	In every lover's game
367	24245	29	
367	24246	30	[Pre-Chorus]
367	24247	31	If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
367	24248	32	Strategy sets the scene for the tale
367	24249	33	I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
367	24250	34	And the liquor in our cocktails
367	24251	35	
367	24252	36	[Chorus]
367	24253	37	What if I told you none of it was accidental?
367	24254	38	And the first night that you saw me
367	24255	39	I knew I wanted your body
367	24256	40	I laid the groundwork, and then
367	24257	41	Just like clockwork
367	24258	42	The dominoes cascaded in a line
367	24259	43	What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
367	24260	44	And now you're mine
367	24261	45	It was all my design
367	24262	46	'Cause I'm a mastermind
367	24263	47	[Bridge]
367	24264	48	No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
367	24265	49	So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since
367	24266	50	To make them love me and make it seem effortless
367	24267	51	This is the first time I've felt the need to confess
367	24268	52	And I swear
367	24269	53	I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian
367	24270	54	'Cause I care
367	24271	55	
367	24272	56	[Chorus]
367	24273	57	So I told you none of it was accidental
367	24274	58	And the first night that you saw me
367	24275	59	Nothing was gonna stop me
367	24276	60	I laid the groundwork, and then
367	24277	61	Saw a wide smirk on your face
367	24278	62	You knew the entire time
367	24279	63	You knew that I'm a mastermind
367	24280	64	And now you're mine
367	24281	65	Yeah, all you did was smile
367	24282	66	'Cause I'm a mastermind2
371	23886	1	[Verse 1]
371	23887	2	Lock broken, slur spoken
371	23888	3	Wound open, game token
371	23889	4	I didn't know you were keeping count
371	23890	5	Rain soaking, blind hoping
371	23891	6	You said I was freeloading
371	23892	7	I didn't know you were keeping count
371	23893	8	
371	23894	9	[Chorus]
371	23895	10	High infidelity
371	23896	11	Put on your records and regret me
371	23897	12	I bent the truth too far tonight
371	23898	13	I was dancing around, dancing around it
371	23899	14	High infidelity
371	23900	15	Put on your headphones and burn my city
371	23901	16	Your picket fence is sharp as knives
371	23902	17	I was dancing around, dancing around it
371	23903	18	[Refrain]
371	23904	19	Do you really wanna know where I was April 29th?
371	23905	20	Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?
371	23906	21	
371	23907	22	[Verse 2]
371	23908	23	Storm coming, good husband
371	23909	24	Bad omen
371	23910	25	Dragged my feet right down the aisle
371	23911	26	At the house lonely, good money
371	23912	27	I'd pay if you'd just know me
371	23913	28	Seemed like the right thing at the time
371	23914	29	
371	23915	30	[Refrain]
371	23916	31	You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
371	23917	32	The slowest way is never loving them enough
371	23918	33	Do you really wanna know where I was April 29th?
371	23919	34	Do I really have to tell you how he brought me back to life?
371	23920	35	
371	23921	36	[Chorus]
371	23922	37	High infidelity
371	23923	38	Put on your records and regret me

371	23948	63	[Post-Chorus]
371	23949	64	Oh, there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
371	23950	65	And it's never enough, it's never enough
371	23951	66	
371	23952	67	[Outro]

371	23956	71	Rain soaking, blind hoping
371	23957	72	You said I was freeloading
371	23958	73	I didn't know you were keeping count
371	23959	74	But, oh, you were keeping count1
427	27586	1	[Verse 1]
427	27587	2	When the morning came
427	27588	3	We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
427	27589	4	'Cause we lost track of time again
427	27590	5	Laughing with my feet in your lap
427	27591	6	Like you were my closest friend
427	27592	7	"How'd we end up on the floor, anyway?" you say
427	27593	8	"Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how"
427	27594	9	I see you every day now
427	27595	10	
427	27596	11	[Chorus]
427	27597	12	And I chose you
427	27598	13	The one I was dancing with
427	27599	14	In New York, no shoes
427	27600	15	Looked up at the sky and it was
427	27601	16	The burgundy on my t-shirt
427	27602	17	When you splashed your wine into me
427	27603	18	And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
427	27604	19	So scarlet, it was
427	27605	20	The mark thеy saw on my collarbone
427	27606	21	The rust that grew bеtween telephones
427	27607	22	The lips I used to call home
427	27608	23	So scarlet, it was maroon
427	27609	24	
427	27610	25	[Verse 2]
427	27611	26	When the silence came
427	27612	27	We were shaking, blind and hazy
427	27613	28	How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
427	27614	29	Sobbing with your head in your hands
427	27615	30	Ain't that the way shit always ends?
427	27616	31	You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
427	27617	32	Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us
427	27618	33	I feel you, no matter what
427	27619	34	The rubies that I gave up
427	27620	35	[Chorus]
427	27621	36	And I lost you
427	27622	37	The one I was dancing with
427	27623	38	In New York, no shoes
427	27624	39	Looked up at the sky and it was (Maroon)
427	27625	40	The burgundy on my t-shirt
427	27626	41	When you splashed your wine into me
427	27627	42	And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
427	27628	43	So scarlet, it was (Maroon)
427	27629	44	The mark they saw on my collarbone
427	27630	45	The rust that grew between telephones
427	27631	46	The lips I used to call home
427	27632	47	So scarlet, it was maroon
427	27633	48	
427	27634	49	[Bridge]
427	27635	50	And I wake with your memory over me
427	27636	51	That's a real fucking legacy, legacy (It was maroon)
427	27637	52	And I wake with your memory over me
427	27638	53	That's a real fucking legacy to leave
427	27639	54	
427	27640	55	[Chorus]
427	27641	56	The burgundy on my t-shirt
427	27642	57	When you splashed your wine into me
427	27643	58	And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
427	27644	59	So scarlet, it was maroon
427	27645	60	The mark they saw on my collarbone
427	27646	61	The rust that grew between telephones
427	27647	62	The lips I used to call home
427	27648	63	So scarlet, it was maroon
427	27649	64	[Outro]
427	27650	65	It was maroon
427	27651	66	It was maroon
429	28072	1	[Verse 1]
429	28073	2	I spy with my little tired eye
429	28074	3	Tiny as a firefly
429	28075	4	A pebble that we picked up last July
429	28076	5	Down deep inside your pocket
429	28077	6	We almost forgot it
429	28078	7	Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
429	28079	8	Ooh, ooh
429	28080	9	
429	28081	10	[Chorus]
429	28082	11	They said the end is comin'
429	28083	12	Everyone’s up to somethin'

429	28087	16	All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'
429	28088	17	
429	28089	18	[Verse 2]
429	28090	19	On the way home
429	28091	20	I wrote a poem
429	28092	21	You say, "What a mind"
429	28093	22	This happens all the time
429	28094	23	Ooh, ooh
429	28095	24

429	28102	31	All that you ever wanted from me was nothin'
429	28103	32	[Bridge]
429	28104	33	Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
429	28105	34	And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
429	28106	35	And the voices that implore, "You should be doing more"
429	28107	36	To you, I can admit that I’m just too soft for all of it
429	28108	37	Ooh
429	28109	38	
429	28110	39	[Chorus]
429	28111	40	They said the end is comin'

431	27717	1	[Intro]
431	27718	2	Rain
431	27719	3	He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
431	27720	4	He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
431	27721	5	Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
431	27722	6	All of me changed like midnight
431	27723	7	
431	27724	8	[Verse 1]
431	27725	9	My town was a wasteland
431	27726	10	Full of cages, full of fences
431	27727	11	Pageant queens and big pretenders
431	27728	12	But for some, it was paradise
431	27729	13	My boy was a montage
431	27730	14	A slow-motion, love potion
431	27731	15	Jumping off things in the ocean
431	27732	16	I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
431	27733	17	He was sunshine, I was midnight rain
431	27734	18	
431	27735	19	[Chorus]
431	27736	20	He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
431	27737	21	He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
431	27738	22	Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
431	27739	23	All of me changed like midnight
431	27740	24	
431	27741	25	[Verse 2]
431	27742	26	It came like a postcard
431	27743	27	Picture perfect shiny family
431	27744	28	Holiday peppermint candy
431	27745	29	But for him, it's every day
431	27746	30	So I peered through a window
431	27747	31	A deep portal, time travel
431	27748	32	All the love we unravel
431	27749	33	And the life I gave away
431	27750	34	'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain
431	27751	35	[Chorus]
431	27752	36	He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
431	27753	37	He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
431	27754	38	Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
431	27755	39	All of me changed like midnight rain
431	27756	40	He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
431	27757	41	He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
431	27758	42	Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
431	27759	43	All of me changed like midnight
431	27760	44	
431	27761	45	[Outro]
431	27762	46	I guess sometimes we all get
431	27763	47	Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
431	27764	48	And he never thinks of me
431	27765	49	Except for when I'm on TV
431	27766	50	I guess sometimes we all get
431	27767	51	Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
431	27768	52	And I never think of him
431	27769	53	Except on midnights like this
431	27770	54	(Midnights like this, midnights like this)3
433	28195	1	[Verse 1]
433	28196	2	Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
433	28197	3	You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them
433	28198	4	Sometimes I wonder which one'll be your last lie
433	28199	5	They say looks can kill and I might try
433	28200	6	I don't dress for women
433	28201	7	I don't dress for men
433	28202	8	Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge
433	28203	9	
433	28204	10	[Chorus]
433	28205	11	I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
433	28206	12	Don't get sad, get even
433	28207	13	So on the weekends
433	28208	14	I don't dress for friends
433	28209	15	Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge
433	28210	16	
433	28211	17	[Verse 2]
433	28212	18	She needed cold, hard proof, so I gave her some
433	28213	19	She had the envelope, where you think she got it from?
433	28214	20	Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride
433	28215	21	Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife
433	28216	22	And she looks so pretty
433	28217	23	Drivin' in your Benz
433	28218	24	Lately, she's been dressin' for revenge
433	28219	25	
433	28220	26	[Chorus]
433	28221	27	She don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ends
433	28222	28	Don't get sad, get even
433	28223	29	So on the weekends
433	28224	30	She don't dress for friends
433	28225	31	Lately, she's been dressing for revenge
433	28226	32	[Bridge]
433	28227	33	Ladies always rise above

446	27235	12	[Chorus]
446	27236	13	Oh, my, love is a lie
446	27237	14	Shit my friends say to get me by
446	27238	15	It hits different
446	27239	16	It hits different this time
446	27240	17	Catastrophic blues
446	27241	18	Movin' on was always easy for me to do

446	27249	26	I used to switch out these Kens, I'd just ghost
446	27250	27	Rip the band-aid off and skip town likе an asshole outlaw
446	27251	28	Freedom felt like summеr then on the coast
446	27252	29	Now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings
446	27253	30	And I never don't cry (And I never don't cry) at the bar
446	27254	31	Yeah, my sadness is contagious (My sadness is contagious)
446	27255	32	I slur your name 'til someone puts me in a car
446	27256	33	I stopped receiving invitations

446	27271	48	I find the artifacts, cried over a hat
446	27272	49	Cursed the space that I needed
446	27273	50	I trace the evidence, make it make some sense
446	27274	51	Why the wound is still bleedin'
446	27275	52	You were the one that I loved
446	27276	53	Don't need another metaphor, it's simple enough
446	27277	54	A wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes
446	27278	55	This is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy
446	27279	56	Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief
446	27280	57	In the good in the world, you once believed in me
446	27281	58	And I felt you and I held you for a while
446	27282	59	Bet I could still melt your world
446	27283	60	Argumentative, antithetical dream girl
446	27284	61	[Verse 3]
446	27285	62	I heard your key turn in the door down the hallway
446	27286	63	Is that your key in the door?
446	27287	64	Is it okay? Is it you?
446	27288	65	Or have they come to take me away?
446	27289	66	To take me away

472	30706	1	[Verse 1]
472	30707	2	I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
472	30708	3	Busy streets and busy lives
472	30709	4	And all we know is touch and go
472	30710	5	We are alone with our changing minds
472	30711	6	We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
472	30712	7	Or fades in time

472	30714	9	[Chorus]
472	30715	10	And I never (Never)

472	30718	13	Be the same
472	30719	14	[Verse 2]
472	30720	15	You come around and the armor falls
472	30721	16	Pierce the room like a cannonball
472	30722	17	Now, all we know is don’t let go
472	30723	18	We are alone, just you and me
472	30724	19	Up in your room and our slates are clean
472	30725	20	Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
472	30726	21	
472	30727	22	[Pre-Chorus]
472	30728	23	So you were never a saint
472	30729	24	And I've loved in shades of wrong
472	30730	25	We learn to live with the pain
472	30731	26	Mosaic broken hearts

472	30741	36	This is a state of grace
472	30742	37	This is the worthwhile fight
472	30743	38	Love is a ruthless game
472	30744	39	Unless you play it good and right
472	30745	40	These are the hands of fate
472	30746	41	You’re my Achilles heel
472	30747	42	This is the golden age
472	30748	43	Of something good and right and real

473	30544	1	[Verse 1]
473	30545	2	Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
473	30546	3	Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
473	30547	4	Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
473	30548	5	Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all
473	30549	6	
473	30550	7	[Chorus]
473	30551	8	Losing him was blue like I'd never known
473	30552	9	Missing him was dark gray, all alone
473	30553	10	Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
473	30554	11	But loving him was red

473	30561	18	
473	30562	19	[Verse 2]
473	30563	20	Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
473	30564	21	Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
473	30565	22	Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
473	30566	23	Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
473	30567	24	
473	30568	25	[Chorus]
473	30569	26	Losing him was blue like I'd never known

473	30579	36	
473	30580	37	[Bridge]
473	30581	38	Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
473	30582	39	Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
473	30583	40	But moving on from him is impossible
473	30584	41	When I still see it all in my head
473	30585	42	In burning red
473	30586	43	Burning, it was red
473	30587	44	[Chorus]
473	30588	45	Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
473	30589	46	Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
473	30590	47	Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met

474	31025	1	[Verse 1]
474	31026	2	Put your lips close to mine
474	31027	3	As long as they don't touch
474	31028	4	Out of focus, eye to eye
474	31029	5	'Til the gravity's too much
474	31030	6	And I'll do anything you say
474	31031	7	If you say it with your hands
474	31032	8	And I'd be smart to walk away
474	31033	9	But you're quicksand

474	31039	15	And I-I-I like it
474	31040	16	[Verse 2]
474	31041	17	I can't decide if it's a choice
474	31042	18	Getting swept away
474	31043	19	I hear the sound of my own voice
474	31044	20	Asking you to stay
474	31045	21	And all we are is skin and bone
474	31046	22	Trained to get along
474	31047	23	Forever going with the flow
474	31048	24	But you're friction

474	31050	26	[Chorus]

474	31057	33	Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
474	31058	34	And I will get you, get you alone
474	31059	35	Your name has echoed through my mind
474	31060	36	And I just think you should, think you should know
474	31061	37	That nothing safe is worth the drive

476	30021	13	And I know it's long gone and
476	30022	14	That magic's not here no more
476	30023	15	And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
476	30024	16	Oh, oh, oh
476	30025	17	
476	30026	18	[Chorus]
476	30027	19	'Cause there we are again on that little town street
476	30028	20	You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
476	30029	21	Wind in my hair, I was there
476	30030	22	I remember it all too well
476	30031	23	
476	30032	24	[Verse 3]
476	30033	25	Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
476	30034	26	You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
476	30035	27	And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
476	30036	28	You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
476	30037	29	
476	30038	30	[Pre-Chorus]
476	30039	31	And I know it's long gone and
476	30040	32	There was nothing else I could do
476	30041	33	And I forget about you long enough
476	30042	34	To forget why I needed to
476	30043	35	[Chorus]
476	30044	36	'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
476	30045	37	We're dancing ‘round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
476	30046	38	Down the stairs, I was there
476	30047	39	I remember it all too well, yeah
476	30048	40	[Bridge]
476	30049	41	Well, maybe we got lost in translation
476	30050	42	Maybe I asked for too much
476	30051	43	But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
476	30052	44	'Til you tore it all up
476	30053	45	Running scared, I was there
476	30054	46	I remember it all too well
476	30055	47	And you call me up again
476	30056	48	Just to break me like a promise
476	30057	49	So casually cruel in the name of being honest
476	30058	50	I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
476	30059	51	'Cause I remember it all, all, all
476	30060	52	Too well
476	30061	53	
476	30062	54	[Verse 4]
476	30063	55	Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
476	30064	56	I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
476	30065	57	After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
476	30066	58	Now, you mail back my things and I walk home alone
476	30067	59	But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
476	30068	60	'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
476	30069	61	You can't get rid of it
476	30070	62	'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
476	30071	63	
476	30072	64	[Chorus]
476	30073	65	'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
476	30074	66	Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
476	30075	67	It was rare, I was there
476	30076	68	I remember it all too well
476	30077	69	[Outro]
476	30078	70	Wind in my hair, you were there
476	30079	71	You remember it all
476	30080	72	Down the stairs, you were there
476	30081	73	You remember it all
476	30082	74	It was rare, I was there
476	30083	75	I remember it all too well14
477	29923	1	[Verse 1]
477	29924	2	It feels like a perfect night
477	29925	3	To dress up like hipsters
477	29926	4	And make fun of our exes
477	29927	5	Uh-uh, uh-uh
477	29928	6	It feels like a perfect night
477	29929	7	For breakfast at midnight
477	29930	8	To fall in love with strangers
477	29931	9	Uh-uh, uh-uh
477	29932	10	
477	29933	11	[Pre-Chorus]
477	29934	12	Yeah
477	29935	13	We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
477	29936	14	It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
477	29937	15	Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
477	29938	16	It's time, oh-oh
477	29939	17	[Chorus]
477	29940	18	I don't know about you
477	29941	19	But I'm feeling twenty-two
477	29942	20	Everything will be alright if
477	29943	21	You keep me next to you
477	29944	22	You don't know about me
477	29945	23	But I'll bet you want to
477	29946	24	Everything will be alright if
477	29947	25	We just keep dancing like we're
477	29948	26	Twenty-two, twenty-two
477	29949	27	
477	29950	28	[Verse 2]
477	29951	29	It seems like one of those nights
477	29952	30	This place is too crowded
477	29953	31	Too many cool kids
477	29954	32	Uh-uh, uh-uh (Who's Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)
477	29955	33	It seems like one of those nights
477	29956	34	We ditch the whole scene
477	29957	35	And end up dreamin'
477	29958	36	Instead of sleeping
477	29959	37	
477	29960	38	[Pre-Chorus]
477	29961	39	Yeah
477	29962	40	We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
477	29963	41	It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
477	29964	42	Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
477	29965	43	It's time, oh-oh
477	29966	44	[Chorus]
477	29967	45	(Hey!) I don't know about you
477	29968	46	But I'm feeling twenty-two
477	29969	47	Everything will be alright if (Ooh)
477	29970	48	You keep me next to you
477	29971	49	You don't know about me
477	29972	50	But I'll bet you want to
477	29973	51	Everything will be alright if (Alright)
477	29974	52	We just keep dancing like we're
477	29975	53	Twenty-two (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh), twenty-two (I don't know about you)
477	29976	54	Twenty-two, twenty-two (Ooh)
477	29977	55	
477	29978	56	[Bridge]
477	29979	57	It feels like one of those nights
477	29980	58	We ditch the whole scene
477	29981	59	It feels like one of those nights
477	29982	60	We won't be sleepin'
477	29983	61	It feels like one of those nights
477	29984	62	You look like bad news
477	29985	63	I gotta have you
477	29986	64	I gotta have you (You)
477	29987	65	Woah, ooh, yeah, eh-yeah

477	29994	72	You don't know about me (You don't know about me)
477	29995	73	But I'll bet you want to
477	29996	74	Everything will be alright if
477	29997	75	We just keep dancing like we're (Dancing like we're twenty-two)
477	29998	76	Twenty-two (Woah-oh), twenty-two (Dancing like)
477	29999	77	Twenty-two (Yeah, yeah), twenty-two (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
477	30000	78	[Outro]
477	30001	79	It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two)

477	30007	85	I gotta have you
477	30008	86	I gotta have you
478	30413	1	[Verse 1]
478	30414	2	I bet this time of night, you’re still up
478	30415	3	I bet you’re tired from a long hard week
478	30416	4	I bet you’re sittin' in your chair by the window
478	30417	5	Looking out at the city, and I bet
478	30418	6	Sometimes, you wonder 'bout me
478	30419	7	
478	30420	8	[Chorus]
478	30421	9	And I just wanna tell you
478	30422	10	It takes everything in me not to call you
478	30423	11	And I wish I could run to you
478	30424	12	And I hope you know that
478	30425	13	Every time I don’t, I almost do, I almost do
478	30426	14	[Verse 2]
478	30427	15	I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
478	30428	16	‘Cause each time you reach out, there’s no reply
478	30429	17	I bet it never, ever occurred to you
478	30430	18	That I can’t say hello to you and risk another goodbye
478	30431	19	
478	30432	20	[Chorus]
478	30433	21	And I just wanna tell you
478	30434	22	It takes everything in me not to call you
478	30435	23	And I wish I could run to you
478	30436	24	And I hope you know that

478	30438	26	
478	30439	27	[Bridge]
478	30440	28	Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
478	30441	29	It’s probably better off this way
478	30442	30	And I confess, babe
478	30443	31	In my dreams, you’re touching my face
478	30444	32	And asking me if I want to try again with you
478	30445	33	And I almost do
478	30446	34	
478	30447	35	[Chorus]
478	30448	36	And I just wanna tell you
478	30449	37	It takes everything in me not to call you
478	30450	38	And I wish I could run to you
478	30451	39	And I hope you know that
478	30452	40	Every time I don’t, I almost do, I almost do
478	30453	41	[Outro]
478	30454	42	I bet this time of night, you’re still up
478	30455	43	I bet you’re tired from a long hard week
478	30456	44	I bet you’re sittin' in your chair by the window
478	30457	45	Looking out at the city, and I hope
478	30458	46	Sometimes, you wonder 'bout me
479	31084	1	[Verse 1]
479	31085	2	I remember when we broke up the first time
479	31086	3	Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
479	31087	4	We hadn't seen each other in a month
479	31088	5	When you said you needed space (What?)
479	31089	6	Then you come around again and say
479	31090	7	"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
479	31091	8	Remember how that lasted for a day?
479	31092	9	I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"
479	31093	10	
479	31094	11	[Pre-Chorus]
479	31095	12	Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
479	31096	13	We called it off again last night, but
479	31097	14	Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
479	31098	15	This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
479	31099	16	[Chorus]
479	31100	17	We are never, ever, ever getting back together
479	31101	18	We are never, ever, ever getting back together
479	31102	19	You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
479	31103	20	But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
479	31104	21	Like, ever
479	31105	22	
479	31106	23	[Verse 2]
479	31107	24	I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
479	31108	25	And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
479	31109	26	And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
479	31110	27	With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
479	31111	28	
479	31112	29	[Pre-Chorus]
479	31113	30	Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
479	31114	31	You called me up again tonight, but
479	31115	32	Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
479	31116	33	This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
479	31117	34

479	31119	36	We (We) are never, ever, ever getting back together
479	31120	37	We are never, ever, ever getting back together
479	31121	38	You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
479	31122	39	But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
479	31123	40	
479	31124	41	[Post-Chorus]
479	31125	42	Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
479	31126	43	Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
479	31127	44	Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
479	31128	45	Oh-oh-oh
479	31129	46	[Bridge]
479	31130	47	I used to think that we were forever, ever
479	31131	48	And I used to say, "Never say never"
479	31132	49	Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you"
479	31133	50	And I'm like, "I just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
479	31134	51	Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever"
479	31135	52	
479	31136	53	[Chorus]
479	31137	54	(No) We are never, ever, ever getting back together
479	31138	55	We are never, ever, ever (Ooh) getting back together
479	31139	56	You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
479	31140	57	But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
479	31141	58	
479	31142	59	[Outro]
479	31143	60	We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)
479	31144	61	Getting back together
479	31145	62	We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
479	31146	63	Getting back together (Yeah)
479	31147	64	You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
479	31148	65	But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together7
480	30769	1	[Verse 1]
480	30770	2	I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
480	30771	3	I threw my phone across the room, at you
480	30772	4	I was expecting some dramatic turn away
480	30773	5	But you stayed
480	30774	6	This morning, I said we should talk about it
480	30775	7	'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
480	30776	8	That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
480	30777	9	And said, "Okay, let's talk"
480	30778	10	And I said
480	30779	11	[Chorus]
480	30780	12	Stay, stay, stay
480	30781	13	I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
480	30782	14	You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
480	30783	15	But I think that it's best if we both stay
480	30784	16	
480	30785	17	[Verse 2]
480	30786	18	Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
480	30787	19	Who took all of their problems out on me
480	30788	20	But you carry my groceries and now, I'm always laughing
480	30789	21	And I love you because you have given me
480	30790	22	No choice but to
480	30791	23	
480	30792	24	[Chorus]
480	30793	25	Stay, stay, stay
480	30794	26	I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
480	30795	27	You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
480	30796	28	But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay
480	30797	29	
480	30798	30	[Bridge]
480	30799	31	You took the time to memorize me
480	30800	32	My fears, my hopes, and dreams
480	30801	33	I just like hanging out with you all the time
480	30802	34	All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me
480	30803	35	I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life
480	30804	36	[Breakdown]
480	30805	37	Stay and I'll be loving you for quite some time
480	30806	38	No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
480	30807	39	So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
480	30808	40	Stay, stay, stay, stay!
480	30809	41	
480	30810	42	[Chorus]
480	30811	43	Stay, stay, stay
480	30812	44	I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
480	30813	45	You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
480	30814	46	But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
480	30815	47	Stay, stay, stay, stay!
480	30816	48	
480	30817	49	[Outro]
480	30818	50	Stay, stay, stay
480	30819	51	I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
480	30820	52	You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
480	30821	53	But I think that it's best if we both stay
480	30822	54	(Ha-ha-ha, it's so fun)
481	30823	1	[Verse 1: Gary]
481	30824	2	Find myself at your door
481	30825	3	Just like all those times before
481	30826	4	I’m not sure how I got there
481	30827	5	All roads, they lead me here
481	30828	6	I imagine you are home
481	30829	7	In your room, all alone
481	30830	8	And you open your eyes into mine
481	30831	9	And everything feels better
481	30832	10	
481	30833	11	[Pre-Chorus: Both]
481	30834	12	And right before your eyes
481	30835	13	I'm breaking, no past
481	30836	14	No reasons why
481	30837	15	Just you and me
481	30838	16	[Chorus: Both]
481	30839	17	This is the last time I'm asking you this
481	30840	18	Put my name at the top of your list
481	30841	19	This is the last time I'm asking you why
481	30842	20	You break my heart in the blink of an eye (Eye, eye)
481	30843	21	
481	30844	22	[Verse 2: Taylor]
481	30845	23	You find yourself at my door
481	30846	24	Just like all those times before
481	30847	25	You wear your best apology
481	30848	26	But I was there to watch you leave
481	30849	27	And all the times I let you in
481	30850	28	Just for you to go again
481	30851	29	Disappear when you come back

481	30854	32	[Pre-Chorus: Both]
481	30855	33	And right before your eyes

481	30858	36	Just you and me

482	30358	1	[Verse 1]
482	30359	2	I was reminiscing just the other day
482	30360	3	While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away
482	30361	4	Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
482	30362	5	Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
482	30363	6	Took off faster than a green light, go
482	30364	7	Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
482	30365	8	I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
482	30366	9	And that was the first day
482	30367	10	
482	30368	11	[Chorus]
482	30369	12	And darling, it was good
482	30370	13	Never looking down
482	30371	14	And right there where we stood
482	30372	15	Was holy ground
482	30373	16	[Verse 2]
482	30374	17	Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
482	30375	18	We had this big wide city all to ourselves
482	30376	19	We blocked the noise with the sound of, "I need you"
482	30377	20	And for the first time, I had something to lose
482	30378	21	And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
482	30379	22	And the story's got dust on every page
482	30380	23	But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
482	30381	24	And I see your face in every crowd
482	30382	25	
482	30383	26	[Chorus]
482	30384	27	'Cause darling, it was good
482	30385	28	Never looking down
482	30386	29	And right there where we stood
482	30387	30	Was holy ground

482	30389	32	[Bridge]
482	30390	33	Tonight, I'm gonna dance
482	30391	34	For all that we've been through
482	30392	35	But I don't wanna dance
482	30393	36	If I'm not dancing with you
482	30394	37	Tonight, I'm gonna dance
482	30395	38	Like you were in this room
482	30396	39	But I don't wanna dance
482	30397	40	If I'm not dancing with you
482	30398	41	[Chorus]
482	30399	42	It was good

482	30412	55	If I'm not dancing with you2
483	30606	1	[Verse 1]
483	30607	2	Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
483	30608	3	Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
483	30609	4	I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
483	30610	5	Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait
483	30611	6	
483	30612	7	[Chorus]
483	30613	8	We had a beautiful magic love there
483	30614	9	What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
483	30615	10	
483	30616	11	[Verse 2]
483	30617	12	In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
483	30618	13	We both wake in lonely beds, different cities
483	30619	14	And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
483	30620	15	And you've got your demons, and darling, they all look like me
483	30621	16	[Chorus]
483	30622	17	'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
483	30623	18	What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
483	30624	19	
483	30625	20	[Bridge]
483	30626	21	Distance, timing
483	30627	22	Breakdown, fighting
483	30628	23	Silence, the train runs off its tracks
483	30629	24	Kiss me, try to fix it
483	30630	25	Could you just try to listen?
483	30631	26	Hang up, give up
483	30632	27	And for the life of us we can't get back
483	30633	28	
483	30634	29	[Breakdown]
483	30635	30	A beautiful, magic love there
483	30636	31	What a sad, beautiful, tragic
483	30637	32	Beautiful, tragic, beautiful
483	30638	33	
483	30639	34	[Chorus]
483	30640	35	What we had, a beautiful magic love there
483	30641	36	What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair
483	30642	37	We had a beautiful magic love there
483	30643	38	What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
484	30894	1	[Verse 1]
484	30895	2	New to town with a made-up name
484	30896	3	In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
484	30897	4	And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
484	30898	5	You had it figured out since you were in school
484	30899	6	Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
484	30900	7	So overnight, you look like a sixties queen
484	30901	8	
484	30902	9	[Pre-Chorus 1]
484	30903	10	Another name goes up in lights
484	30904	11	Like diamonds in the sky
484	30905	12	[Chorus 1]
484	30906	13	And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
484	30907	14	Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
484	30908	15	But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?
484	30909	16	Oh, oh, oh
484	30910	17	
484	30911	18	[Verse 2]
484	30912	19	Now, it’s big black cars and Riviera views
484	30913	20	And your lover in the foyer doesn’t even know you
484	30914	21	And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
484	30915	22	And they tell you that you’re lucky, but you’re so confused
484	30916	23	'Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used
484	30917	24	And all the young things line up to take your place
484	30918	25	
484	30919	26	[Pre-Chorus 2]
484	30920	27	Another name goes up in lights
484	30921	28	You wonder if you’ll make it out alive
484	30922	29	
484	30923	30	[Chorus 1]
484	30924	31	And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
484	30925	32	Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
484	30926	33	But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?
484	30927	34	Oh, oh, oh
484	30928	35	
484	30929	36	[Verse 3]
484	30930	37	It was a few years later, I showed up here
484	30931	38	And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
484	30932	39	How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
484	30933	40	They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
484	30934	41	Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
484	30935	42	And it took some time, but I understand it now
484	30936	43	[Pre-Chorus 3]
484	30937	44	'Cause now my name is up in lights
484	30938	45	But I think you got it right
484	30939	46	
484	30940	47	[Chorus 2]
484	30941	48	Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one
484	30942	49	Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one
484	30943	50	Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
484	30944	51	And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
484	30945	52	Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
484	30946	53	And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh

485	30204	6	Is I know something now
485	30205	7	Know something now I didn't before
485	30206	8	And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
485	30207	9	Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
485	30208	10	In the back of my mind, making me feel like

485	30231	33	And open up the door for you
485	30232	34	And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
485	30233	35	The beautiful kind, making up for lost time

486	30655	12	We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
486	30656	13	Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
486	30657	14	The night we snuck into a yacht club party
486	30658	15	Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

486	30667	24	[Verse 2]
486	30668	25	He said, “Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
486	30669	26	You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way"
486	30670	27	He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
486	30671	28	"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?

487	30085	2	Took a deep breath in the mirror
487	30086	3	He didn't like it when I wore high heels
487	30087	4	But I do
487	30088	5	Turn the lock and put my headphones on
487	30089	6	He always said he didn't get this song

487	30095	12	I walk to you
487	30096	13	You pull my chair out and help me in
487	30097	14	And you don't know how nice that is
487	30098	15	But I do
487	30099	16	[Chorus]
487	30100	17	And you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
487	30101	18	I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
487	30102	19	I've been spending the last eight months
487	30103	20	Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
487	30104	21	But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again
487	30105	22	
487	30106	23	[Verse 3]
487	30107	24	You said you never met one girl who
487	30108	25	Had as many James Taylor records as you
487	30109	26	But I do
487	30110	27	We tell stories and you don't know why
487	30111	28	I'm comin' off a little shy
487	30112	29	But I do
487	30113	30	
487	30114	31	[Chorus]
487	30115	32	But you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
487	30116	33	I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
487	30117	34	I've been spending the last eight months
487	30118	35	Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
487	30119	36	But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again
487	30120	37	
487	30121	38	[Bridge]
487	30122	39	And we walked down the block to my car
487	30123	40	And I almost brought him up
487	30124	41	But you start to talk about the movies
487	30125	42	That your family watches every single Christmas
487	30126	43	And I wanna talk about that
487	30127	44	And for the first time, what's past is past
487	30128	45	[Chorus]
487	30129	46	'Cause you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
487	30130	47	I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
487	30131	48	I've been spending the last eight months
487	30132	49	Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
487	30133	50	But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again
487	30134	51	
487	30135	52	[Outro]
487	30136	53	Hmm, hmm
487	30137	54	But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again
488	30948	1	[Verse 1]
488	30949	2	You should've been there
488	30950	3	Should've burst through the door
488	30951	4	With that "Baby, I'm right here" smile
488	30952	5	And it would've felt like
488	30953	6	A million little shining stars had just aligned
488	30954	7	And I would've been so happy
488	30955	8	
488	30956	9	[Verse 2]
488	30957	10	Christmas lights glisten
488	30958	11	I've got my eye on the door
488	30959	12	Just waiting for you to walk in
488	30960	13	But the time is ticking
488	30961	14	People ask me how I've been
488	30962	15	As I comb back through my memory
488	30963	16	How you said you'd be here
488	30964	17	You said you'd be here
488	30965	18	[Chorus]
488	30966	19	And it was like slow motion
488	30967	20	Standing there in my party dress
488	30968	21	In red lipstick
488	30969	22	With no one to impress
488	30970	23	And they're all laughing
488	30971	24	As I'm looking around the room
488	30972	25	But there was one thing missing
488	30973	26	And that was the moment I knew
488	30974	27	
488	30975	28	[Verse 3]
488	30976	29	And the hours pass by
488	30977	30	Now I just wanna be alone
488	30978	31	But your close friends always seem to know
488	30979	32	When there's something really wrong
488	30980	33	So they follow me down the hall
488	30981	34	And there in the bathroom
488	30982	35	I try not to fall apart
488	30983	36	And the sinking feeling starts
488	30984	37	As I say hopelessly
488	30985	38	"He said he'd be here"
488	30986	39	
488	30987	40	[Chorus]
488	30988	41	And it was like slow motion
488	30989	42	Standing there in my party dress
488	30990	43	In red lipstick
488	30991	44	With no one to impress
488	30992	45	And they're all laughing
488	30993	46	And asking me about you
488	30994	47	But there was one thing missing (Missing)
488	30995	48	And that was the moment I knew
488	30996	49	[Bridge]
488	30997	50	What do you say
488	30998	51	When tears are streaming down your face
488	30999	52	In front of everyone you know?
488	31000	53	And what do you do
488	31001	54	When the one who means the most to you
488	31002	55	Is the one who didn't show?
488	31003	56	
488	31004	57	[Breakdown]
488	31005	58	You should've been here
488	31006	59	And I would've been so happy
488	31007	60	
488	31008	61	[Chorus]
488	31009	62	And it was like slow motion
488	31010	63	Standing there in my party dress
488	31011	64	In red lipstick
488	31012	65	With no one to impress
488	31013	66	And they're all standing around me, singing
488	31014	67	"Happy birthday to you"
488	31015	68	But there was one thing missing
488	31016	69	And that was the moment I knew
488	31017	70	Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
488	31018	71	Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
488	31019	72	
488	31020	73	[Outro]
488	31021	74	You called me later
488	31022	75	And said, "I'm sorry I didn't make it"
488	31023	76	And I said, "I'm sorry, too"
488	31024	77	And that was the moment I knew2
489	30138	1	[Verse 1]
489	30139	2	You said it in a simple way
489	30140	3	4 a.m. the second day
489	30141	4	How strange that I don't know you at all
489	30142	5	Stumbled through the long goodbye
489	30143	6	One last kiss, then catch your flight
489	30144	7	Right when I was just about to fall
489	30145	8	
489	30146	9	[Pre-Chorus]
489	30147	10	I told myself, don't get attached
489	30148	11	But in my mind, I play it back
489	30149	12	Spinning faster than the plane that took you
489	30150	13	[Chorus]
489	30151	14	And this is when the feeling sinks in
489	30152	15	I don't wanna miss you like this
489	30153	16	Come back, be here, come back, be here
489	30154	17	I guess you're in New York today
489	30155	18	I don't wanna need you this way
489	30156	19	Come back, be here, come back, be here
489	30157	20	
489	30158	21	[Verse 2]
489	30159	22	The delicate beginning rush
489	30160	23	The feeling you can know so much
489	30161	24	Without knowing anything at all
489	30162	25	And now that I can put this down
489	30163	26	If I had known what I know now
489	30164	27	I never would've played so nonchalant
489	30165	28	
489	30166	29	[Pre-Chorus]
489	30167	30	Taxi cabs and busy streets
489	30168	31	That never bring you back to me
489	30169	32	I can't help but wish you took me with you
489	30170	33	
489	30171	34	[Chorus]
489	30172	35	And this is when the feeling sinks in
489	30173	36	I don't wanna miss you like this
489	30174	37	Come back, be here, come back, be here
489	30175	38	I guess you're in London today
489	30176	39	And I don't wanna need you this way
489	30177	40	Come back, be here, come back, be here
489	30178	41	[Bridge]
489	30179	42	This is falling in love in the cruelest way
489	30180	43	This is falling for you when you are worlds away
489	30181	44	In New York, be here
489	30182	45	But you're in London, and I break down
489	30183	46	'Cause it's not fair that you're not around
489	30184	47	
489	30185	48	[Chorus]
489	30186	49	This is when the feeling sinks in
489	30187	50	I don't wanna miss you like this
489	30188	51	Come back, be here, come back, be here
489	30189	52	I guess you're in New York today
489	30190	53	And I don't wanna need you this way
489	30191	54	Come back, be here, come back, be here
489	30192	55	
489	30193	56	[Outro]
489	30194	57	Oh-oh, oh-oh
489	30195	58	I don't wanna miss you like this
489	30196	59	Oh-oh, oh-oh
489	30197	60	Come back, be here
489	30198	61	Come back, be here
490	30282	1	[Intro]
490	30283	2	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
490	30284	3	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
490	30285	4	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
490	30286	5	And everybody knows that
490	30287	6	
490	30288	7	[Verse 1]
490	30289	8	I don't even know her
490	30290	9	But I feel a responsibility
490	30291	10	To do what's upstanding and right
490	30292	11	It's kinda like a code, yeah
490	30293	12	And you've been getting closer and closer
490	30294	13	And crossing so many lines
490	30295	14	[Pre-Chorus]
490	30296	15	And it would be a fine proposition
490	30297	16	If I was a stupid girl
490	30298	17	But, honey, I am no one's exception
490	30299	18	This, I have previously learned
490	30300	19	
490	30301	20	[Chorus]
490	30302	21	So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
490	30303	22	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
490	30304	23	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
490	30305	24	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
490	30306	25	I see you turn off your phone
490	30307	26	And now you've got me alone, and I say
490	30308	27	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
490	30309	28	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
490	30310	29	
490	30311	30	[Verse 2]
490	30312	31	I just want to make sure
490	30313	32	You understand perfectly
490	30314	33	You're the kind of man who makes me sad
490	30315	34	While she waits up
490	30316	35	You chase down the newest thing
490	30317	36	And take for granted what you have
490	30318	37	
490	30319	38	[Pre-Chorus]
490	30320	39	And it would be a fine proposition
490	30321	40	If I was a stupid girl
490	30322	41	And, yeah, I might go with it
490	30323	42	If I hadn't once been just like her
490	30324	43	[Chorus]
490	30325	44	So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
490	30326	45	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
490	30327	46	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
490	30328	47	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
490	30329	48	I see you turn off your phone
490	30330	49	And now you've got me alone, and I say
490	30331	50	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
490	30332	51	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
490	30333	52	
490	30334	53	[Post-Chorus]
490	30335	54	Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
490	30336	55	Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
490	30337	56	
490	30338	57	[Bridge]
490	30339	58	Call a cab, lose my number
490	30340	59	You're about to lose your girl
490	30341	60	Call a cab, lose my number
490	30342	61	Let's consider this lesson learned
490	30343	62	
490	30344	63	[Chorus]
490	30345	64	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
490	30346	65	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
490	30347	66	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
490	30348	67	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
490	30349	68	Want to see you pick up your phone
490	30350	69	And tell her you're coming home
490	30351	70	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
490	30352	71	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
490	30353	72	[Outro]
490	30354	73	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
490	30355	74	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
490	30356	75	It would be a fine proposition
490	30357	76	If I hadn't once been just like her
491	32637	1	[Verse 1]
491	32638	2	I'm walkin' fast through the traffic lights
491	32639	3	Busy streets and busy lives
491	32640	4	And all we know is touch and go
491	32641	5	We are alone with our changing minds
491	32642	6	We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
491	32643	7	Or fades in time
491	32644	8	
491	32645	9	[Chorus]
491	32646	10	And I never (Never)
491	32647	11	Saw you comin'
491	32648	12	And I'll never (Never)
491	32649	13	Be the same
491	32650	14	[Verse 2]
491	32651	15	You come around and the armor falls
491	32652	16	Pierce the room like a cannonball
491	32653	17	Now all we know is don't let go
491	32654	18	We are alone, just you and me
491	32655	19	Up in your room and our slates are clean
491	32656	20	Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
491	32657	21	
491	32658	22	[Pre-Chorus]
491	32659	23	So you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong
491	32660	24	We learn to live with the pain, mosaic broken hearts
491	32661	25	But this love is brave and wild
491	32662	26	
491	32663	27	[Chorus]
491	32664	28	And I never (Never)
491	32665	29	Saw you comin'
491	32666	30	And I'll never (Never)
491	32667	31	Be the same
491	32668	32	
491	32669	33	[Bridge]
491	32670	34	This is a state of grace
491	32671	35	This is the worthwhile fight
491	32672	36	Love is a ruthless game
491	32673	37	Unless you play it good and right
491	32674	38	These are the hands of fate
491	32675	39	You're my Achilles heel
491	32676	40	This is the golden age
491	32677	41	Of something good and right and real
491	32678	42	[Chorus]
491	32679	43	And I never (Never)
491	32680	44	Saw you comin'
491	32681	45	And I'll never
491	32682	46	Be the same, oh
491	32683	47	And I never (Never)
491	32684	48	Saw you comin'
491	32685	49	And I'll never (Never)
491	32686	50	(So you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong)
491	32687	51	Be the same (We learn to live with the pain, mosaic broken hearts)
491	32688	52	(But this love is brave and wild)
491	32689	53	
491	32690	54	[Outro]
491	32691	55	This is a state of grace
491	32692	56	This is the worthwhile fight
491	32693	57	Love is a ruthless game
491	32694	58	Unless you play it good and right2
492	32322	1	[Verse 1]
492	32323	2	Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
492	32324	3	Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
492	32325	4	Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
492	32326	5	Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all
492	32327	6	
492	32328	7	[Chorus]
492	32329	8	Losing him was blue like I'd never known
492	32330	9	Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
492	32331	10	Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
492	32332	11	But loving him was red (Red, red)
492	32333	12	(Red, red)
492	32334	13	But loving him was red (Red, red)
492	32335	14	(Red, red)
492	32336	15	[Verse 2]
492	32337	16	Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
492	32338	17	Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
492	32339	18	Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
492	32340	19	Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
492	32341	20	
492	32342	21	[Chorus]
492	32343	22	Losing him was blue like I'd never known
492	32344	23	Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
492	32345	24	Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
492	32346	25	But loving him was red (Red, red)
492	32347	26	Oh, red (Red, red)
492	32348	27	Burning red (Red, red)
492	32349	28	(Red, red)
492	32350	29	
492	32351	30	[Bridge]
492	32352	31	Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
492	32353	32	Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
492	32354	33	But moving on from him is impossible when I still see it all in my head
492	32355	34	In burning red
492	32356	35	Burning, it was red
492	32357	36	
492	32358	37	[Chorus]
492	32359	38	Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
492	32360	39	Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
492	32361	40	Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
492	32362	41	'Cause loving him was red (Red, red)
492	32363	42	Yeah, yeah, red (Red, red)
492	32364	43	Oh, burning red (Red, red)
492	32365	44	(Red, red)
492	32366	45	[Post-Chorus]
492	32367	46	And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head (Red, red)
492	32368	47	Comes back to me, burning red (Red, red)
492	32369	48	(Red, red)
492	32370	49	Yeah, yeah (Red, red)
492	32371	50	
492	32372	51	[Outro]
492	32373	52	His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street2
493	33030	1	[Verse 1]
493	33031	2	Put your lips close to mine
493	33032	3	As long as they don't touch
493	33033	4	Out of focus, eye to eye
493	33034	5	'Til the gravity's too much
493	33035	6	And I'll do anything you say
493	33036	7	If you say it with your hands
493	33037	8	And I'd be smart to walk away
493	33038	9	But you're quicksand
493	33039	10	
493	33040	11	[Chorus]
493	33041	12	This slope is treacherous
493	33042	13	This path is reckless
493	33043	14	This slope is treacherous
493	33044	15	And I-I-I like it
493	33045	16	[Verse 2]
493	33046	17	I can't decide if it's a choice
493	33047	18	Getting swept away
493	33048	19	I hear the sound of my own voice
493	33049	20	Asking you to stay
493	33050	21	All we are is skin and bone
493	33051	22	Trained to get along
493	33052	23	Forever going with the flow
493	33053	24	But you're friction
493	33054	25	
493	33055	26	[Chorus]
493	33056	27	This slope is treacherous
493	33057	28	This path is reckless
493	33058	29	This slope is treacherous
493	33059	30	I-I-I like it
493	33060	31	
493	33061	32	[Bridge]
493	33062	33	Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
493	33063	34	And I will get you a, get you alone
493	33064	35	Your name has echoed through my mind
493	33065	36	And I just think you should, think you should know
493	33066	37	That nothing safe is worth the drive
493	33067	38	And I would follow you, follow you home
493	33068	39	I'll follow you, follow you home
493	33069	40	
493	33070	41	[Chorus]
493	33071	42	This hope is treacherous
493	33072	43	This daydream is dangerous
493	33073	44	This hope is treacherous
493	33074	45	I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I—
493	33075	46	[Bridge]
493	33076	47	Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
493	33077	48	And I will get you a, get you alone
493	33078	49	Your name has echoed through my mind
493	33079	50	And I just think you should, think you should know
493	33080	51	That nothing safe is worth the drive
493	33081	52	And I will follow you, follow you home
493	33082	53	I'll follow you, follow you home
493	33083	54	I'll follow you, follow you home
493	33084	55	I'll follow you, follow you home
493	33085	56	
493	33086	57	[Outro]
493	33087	58	This slope is treacherous
493	33088	59	I-I-I like it
494	32122	1	[Türkçe Çeviri]
494	32123	2	Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
494	32124	3	I was in your sights, you got me alone
494	32125	4	You found me, you found me
494	32126	5	You found me-e-e-e-e
494	32127	6	I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
494	32128	7	And when I fell hard, you took a step back
494	32129	8	Without me, without me
494	32130	9	Without me-e-e-e-e
494	32131	10	
494	32132	11	[Pre-Chorus]
494	32133	12	And he's long gone when he's next to me
494	32134	13	And I realize the blame is on me
494	32135	14	[Chorus]
494	32136	15	'Cause I knew you were troublе when you walked in
494	32137	16	So shame on mе now
494	32138	17	Flew me to places I'd never been

494	32148	27	
494	32149	28	[Verse 2]
494	32150	29	No apologies, he'll never see you cry
494	32151	30	Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
494	32152	31	You're drowning, you're drowning
494	32153	32	You're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing
494	32154	33	And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
494	32155	34	A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
494	32156	35	And now I see, now I see
494	32157	36	Now I see-e-e-e-e
494	32158	37	
494	32159	38	[Pre-Chorus]
494	32160	39	He was long gone when he met me
494	32161	40	And I realize the joke is on me, hey
494	32162	41	[Chorus]
494	32163	42	I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh)
494	32164	43	So shame on me now

494	32177	56	And the saddest fear
494	32178	57	Comes creeping in
494	32179	58	That you never loved me or her
494	32180	59	Or anyone, or anything, yeah
494	32181	60	
494	32182	61	[Chorus]

495	31376	1	[Verse 1]
495	31377	2	I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
495	31378	3	But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
495	31379	4	And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
495	31380	5	And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
495	31381	6	
495	31382	7	[Verse 2]
495	31383	8	Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
495	31384	9	We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
495	31385	10	Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
495	31386	11	And I can picture it after all these days
495	31387	12	[Pre-Chorus]
495	31388	13	And I know it's long gone and
495	31389	14	That magic's not here no more
495	31390	15	And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
495	31391	16	Oh, oh, oh
495	31392	17	
495	31393	18	[Chorus]
495	31394	19	'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
495	31395	20	You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
495	31396	21	Wind in my hair, I was there
495	31397	22	I remember it all too well
495	31398	23	
495	31399	24	[Verse 3]
495	31400	25	Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
495	31401	26	You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
495	31402	27	And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
495	31403	28	You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
495	31404	29	
495	31405	30	[Pre-Chorus]
495	31406	31	And I know it's long gone and
495	31407	32	There was nothing else I could do
495	31408	33	And I forget about you long enough
495	31409	34	To forget why I needed to
495	31410	35	[Chorus]
495	31411	36	'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
495	31412	37	We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
495	31413	38	Down the stairs, I was there
495	31414	39	I remember it all too well, yeah
495	31415	40	[Bridge]
495	31416	41	And maybe we got lost in translation
495	31417	42	Maybe I asked for too much
495	31418	43	But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
495	31419	44	'Til you tore it all up
495	31420	45	Running scared, I was there
495	31421	46	I remember it all too well
495	31422	47	And you call me up again
495	31423	48	Just to break me like a promise
495	31424	49	So casually cruel in the name of being honest
495	31425	50	I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
495	31426	51	'Cause I remember it all, all, all
495	31427	52	Too well
495	31428	53	
495	31429	54	[Verse 4]
495	31430	55	Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
495	31431	56	I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
495	31432	57	After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
495	31433	58	Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
495	31434	59	But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
495	31435	60	'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
495	31436	61	You can't get rid of it
495	31437	62	'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
495	31438	63	
495	31439	64	[Chorus]
495	31440	65	'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
495	31441	66	Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
495	31442	67	It was rare, I was there
495	31443	68	I remember it all too well
495	31444	69	[Outro]
495	31445	70	Wind in my hair, you were there
495	31446	71	You remember it all

495	31448	73	You remember it all

495	31450	75	I remember it all too well1
496	31149	1	[Verse 1]
496	31150	2	It feels like a perfect night
496	31151	3	To dress up like hipsters
496	31152	4	And make fun of our exes
496	31153	5	Uh-uh, uh-uh
496	31154	6	It feels like a perfect night
496	31155	7	For breakfast at midnight
496	31156	8	To fall in love with strangers
496	31157	9	Uh-uh, uh-uh
496	31158	10	
496	31159	11	[Pre-Chorus]
496	31160	12	Yeah
496	31161	13	We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
496	31162	14	It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
496	31163	15	Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
496	31164	16	It's time, oh-oh
496	31165	17	[Chorus]
496	31166	18	I don't know about you
496	31167	19	But I'm feelin' twenty-two

496	31178	30	It seems like one of those nights
496	31179	31	This place is too crowded
496	31180	32	Too many cool kids
496	31181	33	Uh-uh, uh-uh (Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew)
496	31182	34	It seems like one of those nights
496	31183	35	We ditch the whole scene
496	31184	36	And end up dreamin'
496	31185	37	Instead of sleepin'
496	31186	38

497	32032	30	Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
497	32033	31	It's probably better off this way
497	32034	32	And I confess, baby
497	32035	33	In my dreams, you're touching my face
497	32036	34	And asking me if I wanna try again with you
497	32037	35	And I almost do
497	32038	36	
497	32039	37	[Chorus]
497	32040	38	And I just wanna tell you
497	32041	39	It takes everything in me not to call you
497	32042	40	And I wish I could run to you
497	32043	41	And I hope you know that every time I don't
497	32044	42	I almost do
497	32045	43	I almost do
497	32046	44	[Outro]
497	32047	45	I bet this time of night, you’re still up
497	32048	46	I bet you're tired from a long hard week
497	32049	47	I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window
497	32050	48	Looking out at the city, and I hope
497	32051	49	Sometimes you wonder 'bout me
498	33089	1	[Verse 1]
498	33090	2	I remember when we broke up
498	33091	3	The first time, sayin', "This is it, I've had enough"
498	33092	4	'Cause, like, we hadn't seen each other in a month
498	33093	5	When you said you needed space (What?)
498	33094	6	Then you come around again and say
498	33095	7	"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change"
498	33096	8	"Trust me," remember how that lasted for a day?
498	33097	9	I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"
498	33098	10	
498	33099	11	[Pre-Chorus]
498	33100	12	Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
498	33101	13	We called it off again last night, but
498	33102	14	Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
498	33103	15	This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
498	33104	16	[Chorus]
498	33105	17	We are never, evеr, ever getting back togеther
498	33106	18	We are never, ever, ever getting back together
498	33107	19	You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
498	33108	20	But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
498	33109	21	
498	33110	22	[Post-Chorus]
498	33111	23	Like, ever
498	33112	24	
498	33113	25	[Verse 2]
498	33114	26	I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
498	33115	27	And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
498	33116	28	And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
498	33117	29	With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
498	33118	30	
498	33119	31	[Pre-Chorus]
498	33120	32	Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
498	33121	33	You called me up again tonight, but
498	33122	34	Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
498	33123	35	This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
498	33124	36	
498	33125	37	[Chorus]
498	33126	38	We (We) are never, ever, ever getting back together
498	33127	39	We are never, ever, ever getting back together
498	33128	40	You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
498	33129	41	But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
498	33130	42	[Post-Chorus]
498	33131	43	Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
498	33132	44	Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
498	33133	45	Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
498	33134	46	Oh
498	33135	47	
498	33136	48	[Bridge]
498	33137	49	I used to think that we were forever, ever
498	33138	50	And I used to say, "Never say never"
498	33139	51	Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you"
498	33140	52	And I'm, like, I'm just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
498	33141	53	Like, we are never getting back together
498	33142	54	Like, ever (No)
498	33143	55	
498	33144	56	[Chorus]
498	33145	57	We are never, ever, ever getting back together
498	33146	58	We are never, ever, ever (Ooh) getting back together
498	33147	59	You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
498	33148	60	But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
498	33149	61	
498	33150	62	[Outro]
498	33151	63	We (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
498	33152	64	No, getting back together (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
498	33153	65	We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
498	33154	66	Oh, getting back together, yeah (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
498	33155	67	You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
498	33156	68	But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together1
499	32695	1	[Verse 1]
499	32696	2	I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
499	32697	3	I threw my phone across the room at you
499	32698	4	I was expecting some dramatic turn away
499	32699	5	But you stayed
499	32700	6	This morning, I said we should talk about it
499	32701	7	'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
499	32702	8	That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
499	32703	9	And said, "Okay, let's talk"
499	32704	10	
499	32705	11	[Chorus]
499	32706	12	And I said, "Stay, stay, stay"
499	32707	13	I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
499	32708	14	You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
499	32709	15	But I think that it's best if we both stay
499	32710	16	[Verse 2]
499	32711	17	Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
499	32712	18	Who took all of their problems out on me
499	32713	19	But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
499	32714	20	And I love you because you have given me
499	32715	21	
499	32716	22	[Chorus]
499	32717	23	No choice but to stay, stay, stay
499	32718	24	I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
499	32719	25	You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
499	32720	26	But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay
499	32721	27	
499	32722	28	[Bridge]
499	32723	29	You took the time to memorize me
499	32724	30	My fears, my hopes, and dreams
499	32725	31	I just like hanging out with you
499	32726	32	All the time
499	32727	33	All those times that you didn't leave
499	32728	34	It's been occurring to me
499	32729	35	I'd like to hang out with you
499	32730	36	For my whole life
499	32731	37	
499	32732	38	[Chorus]
499	32733	39	Stay
499	32734	40	And I'll be loving you for quite some time
499	32735	41	No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
499	32736	42	So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
499	32737	43	Stay, stay, stay
499	32738	44	I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
499	32739	45	You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
499	32740	46	But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
499	32741	47	Stay, stay, stay
499	32742	48	I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
499	32743	49	You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
499	32744	50	But I think that it's best if we both stay
499	32745	51	[Outro]
499	32746	52	That's so fun
500	32747	1	[Verse 1: Gary Lightbody]
500	32748	2	I find myself at your door
500	32749	3	Just like all those times before
500	32750	4	I’m not sure how I got there
500	32751	5	All roads they lead me here
500	32752	6	I imagine you are home
500	32753	7	In your room, all alone
500	32754	8	And you open your eyes into mine
500	32755	9	And everything feels better
500	32756	10	
500	32757	11	[Pre-Chorus: Both]
500	32758	12	And right before your eyes
500	32759	13	I'm breaking
500	32760	14	No past, no reasons why
500	32761	15	Just you and me
500	32762	16	[Chorus: Both]
500	32763	17	This is the last time I'm asking you this
500	32764	18	Put my name at the top of your list
500	32765	19	This is the last time I'm asking you why
500	32766	20	You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye
500	32767	21	
500	32768	22	[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
500	32769	23	You find yourself at my door
500	32770	24	And just like all those times before
500	32771	25	You wear your best apology
500	32772	26	But I was there to watch you leave
500	32773	27	And all the times I let you in
500	32774	28	Just for you to go again
500	32775	29	Disappear when you come back
500	32776	30	Everything is better
500	32777	31	
500	32778	32	[Pre-Chorus: Both]
500	32779	33	And right before your eyes
500	32780	34	I'm aching
500	32781	35	No past, nowhere to hide
500	32782	36	Just you and me
500	32783	37	
500	32784	38	[Chorus: Both]
500	32785	39	This is the last time I'm asking you this
500	32786	40	Put my name at the top of your list
500	32787	41	This is the last time I'm asking you why
500	32788	42	You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye
500	32789	43	[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Gary Lightbody, Both]
500	32790	44	This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
500	32791	45	This is the last time I say, "It's been you all along"
500	32792	46	This is the last time I let you in my door
500	32793	47	This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore
500	32794	48	Oh, oh, oh, oh
500	32795	49	Oh, oh, oh, oh
500	32796	50	[Chorus: Both, Taylor Swift, Gary Lightbody]
500	32797	51	This is the last time I'm asking you this
500	32798	52	Put my name at the top of your list
500	32799	53	This is the last time I'm asking you why

500	32805	59	
500	32806	60	[Outro: Both]
500	32807	61	This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
500	32808	62	Last time I'm asking you this
500	32809	63	This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
500	32810	64	Last time I'm asking you this
500	32811	65	This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
500	32812	66	Last time I'm asking you this
500	32813	67	This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
500	32814	68	Last time I'm asking you this2
501	31948	1	[Verse 1]
501	31949	2	I was reminiscing just the other day
501	31950	3	While having coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
501	31951	4	Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
501	31952	5	Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
501	31953	6	Took off faster than a green light, go
501	31954	7	Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
501	31955	8	I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
501	31956	9	And that was the first day
501	31957	10	
501	31958	11	[Chorus]
501	31959	12	And darling, it was good
501	31960	13	Never looking down
501	31961	14	And right there where we stood
501	31962	15	Was holy ground
501	31963	16	[Verse 2]
501	31964	17	Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
501	31965	18	We had this big, wide city all to ourselves
501	31966	19	Wе block the noise with the sound of "I need you"
501	31967	20	And for thе first time, I had something to lose
501	31968	21	And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
501	31969	22	And the story's got dust on every page
501	31970	23	But, sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
501	31971	24	And I see your face in every crowd
501	31972	25	
501	31973	26	[Chorus]
501	31974	27	'Cause, darling, it was good
501	31975	28	Never looking down
501	31976	29	And right there where we stood
501	31977	30	Was holy ground
501	31978	31	
501	31979	32	[Bridge]
501	31980	33	Tonight, I'm gonna dance
501	31981	34	For all that we've been through
501	31982	35	But I don't wanna dance
501	31983	36	If I'm not dancing with you
501	31984	37	Tonight, I'm gonna dance
501	31985	38	Like you were in this room
501	31986	39	But I don't wanna dance
501	31987	40	If I'm not dancing with you
501	31988	41	[Chorus]
501	31989	42	It was good
501	31990	43	Never looking down
501	31991	44	And right there where we stood
501	31992	45	Was holy ground
501	31993	46	
501	31994	47	[Outro]
501	31995	48	Tonight, I'm gonna dance
501	31996	49	For all that we've been through
501	31997	50	But I don't wanna dance
501	31998	51	If I'm not dancing with you
501	31999	52	Tonight, I'm gonna dance
501	32000	53	Like you were in this room
501	32001	54	But I don't wanna dance
501	32002	55	If I'm not dancing with you
502	32487	1	[Verse 1]
502	32488	2	Long handwritten notes, deep in your pocket
502	32489	3	Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
502	32490	4	I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
502	32491	5	Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait
502	32492	6	
502	32493	7	[Chorus]
502	32494	8	We had a beautiful, magic love there
502	32495	9	What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
502	32496	10	
502	32497	11	[Verse 2]
502	32498	12	In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
502	32499	13	And we both wake in lonely beds and different cities
502	32500	14	And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
502	32501	15	And you've got your demons and, darling, they all look like me
502	32502	16	[Chorus]
502	32503	17	'Cause wе had a beautiful, magic love therе
502	32504	18	What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
502	32505	19	
502	32506	20	[Post-Chorus]
502	32507	21	Woah, woah
502	32508	22	
502	32509	23	[Bridge]
502	32510	24	Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
502	32511	25	Silence, the train runs off its tracks
502	32512	26	Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
502	32513	27	Hang up, give up and for the life of us, we can't get back
502	32514	28	
502	32515	29	[Chorus]
502	32516	30	A beautiful, magic love there
502	32517	31	What a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful
502	32518	32	What we had, a beautiful, magic love there
502	32519	33	What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
502	32520	34	We had a beautiful, magic love there
502	32521	35	What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
503	32815	1	[Verse 1]
503	32816	2	New to town with a made-up name
503	32817	3	In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
503	32818	4	And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
503	32819	5	You had it figured out since you were in school
503	32820	6	Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
503	32821	7	So overnight, you look like a sixties queen
503	32822	8	
503	32823	9	[Pre-Chorus]
503	32824	10	Another name goes up in lights
503	32825	11	Like diamonds in the sky
503	32826	12	[Chorus]
503	32827	13	And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
503	32828	14	Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
503	32829	15	But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
503	32830	16	Oh, oh, oh
503	32831	17	
503	32832	18	[Verse 2]
503	32833	19	And now, it's big black cars and Riviera views
503	32834	20	And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
503	32835	21	And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
503	32836	22	And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
503	32837	23	'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
503	32838	24	And all the young things line up to take your place
503	32839	25	
503	32840	26	[Pre-Chorus]
503	32841	27	Another name goes up in lights
503	32842	28	You wonder if you'll make it out alive
503	32843	29	
503	32844	30	[Chorus]
503	32845	31	And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
503	32846	32	Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
503	32847	33	Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
503	32848	34	Oh, oh, oh
503	32849	35	Oh, oh, oh
503	32850	36	
503	32851	37	[Verse 3]
503	32852	38	It was a few years later, I showed up here
503	32853	39	And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
503	32854	40	How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
503	32855	41	They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
503	32856	42	Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
503	32857	43	And it took some time, but I understand it now
503	32858	44	[Pre-Chorus]
503	32859	45	'Cause now my name is up in lights
503	32860	46	But I think you got it right
503	32861	47	
503	32862	48	[Chorus]
503	32863	49	Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one

504	31721	3	
504	31722	4	[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
504	31723	5	All I knew this morning when I woke
504	31724	6	Is I know something now
504	31725	7	Know something now I didn't before
504	31726	8	And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
504	31727	9	Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
504	31728	10	In the back of my mind, making me feel like
504	31729	11	[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
504	31730	12	I just wanna know you better

504	31747	29	Is everything has changed
504	31748	30	
504	31749	31	[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift]
504	31750	32	And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
504	31751	33	But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
504	31752	34	And open up the door for you
504	31753	35	And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
504	31754	36	The beautiful kind, makin' up for lost time
504	31755	37	Takin' flight, making me feel like
504	31756	38	[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]

504	31805	87	Is everything has changed
505	32522	1	[Chorus]
505	32523	2	I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
505	32524	3	It was the best night
505	32525	4	Never would forget how he moved
505	32526	5	The whole place was dressed to the nines
505	32527	6	And we were dancing, dancing
505	32528	7	Like we're made of starlight
505	32529	8	Like we're made of starlight
505	32530	9	
505	32531	10	[Verse 1]
505	32532	11	I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
505	32533	12	Picks me up late one night
505	32534	13	Out the window, we were seventeen and crazy, running wild, wild
505	32535	14	Can't remember what song it was playing whеn we walked in
505	32536	15	The night wе snuck into a yacht club party
505	32537	16	Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
505	32538	17	[Chorus]
505	32539	18	And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
505	32540	19	It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
505	32541	20	The whole place was dressed to the nines
505	32542	21	And we were dancing, dancing
505	32543	22	Like we're made of starlight, starlight
505	32544	23	Like we're made of starlight, starlight
505	32545	24	
505	32546	25	[Verse 2]
505	32547	26	He said, "Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
505	32548	27	You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way"
505	32549	28	He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
505	32550	29	"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
505	32551	30	Don't you dream impossible things?"
505	32552	31	
505	32553	32	[Chorus]
505	32554	33	Like, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
505	32555	34	It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
505	32556	35	The whole place was dressed to the nines
505	32557	36	And we were dancing, dancing
505	32558	37	Like we're made of starlight, starlight
505	32559	38	Like we're made of starlight, starlight
505	32560	39	
505	32561	40	[Bridge]
505	32562	41	Ooh-ooh, he's talking crazy
505	32563	42	Ooh-ooh, dancing with me
505	32564	43	Ooh-ooh, we could get married
505	32565	44	Have ten kids and teach them how to dream
505	32566	45	[Post-Chorus]
505	32567	46	(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
505	32568	47	(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
505	32569	48	(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
505	32570	49	(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
505	32571	50	
505	32572	51	[Chorus]
505	32573	52	Oh my, what a marvelous tune
505	32574	53	It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
505	32575	54	The whole place was dressed to the nines
505	32576	55	And we were dancing, dancing
505	32577	56	Like we're made of starlight, starlight
505	32578	57	Like we're made of starlight, starlight
505	32579	58	
505	32580	59	[Breakdown]
505	32581	60	Like we're made of starlight, starlight
505	32582	61	Like we dream impossible dreams
505	32583	62	Like starlight, starlight
505	32584	63	Like we dream impossible dreams
505	32585	64	
505	32586	65	[Outro]
505	32587	66	Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
505	32588	67	Don't you dream impossible things?
506	31521	1	[Verse 1]
506	31522	2	Took a deep breath in the mirror
506	31523	3	He didn't like it when I wore high heels
506	31524	4	But I do
506	31525	5	Turn the lock and put my headphones on
506	31526	6	He always said he didn't get this song
506	31527	7	But I do, I do
506	31528	8	
506	31529	9	[Verse 2]
506	31530	10	I walked in, expecting you'd be late
506	31531	11	But you got here early and you stand and wave
506	31532	12	I walk to you
506	31533	13	You pull my chair out and help me in
506	31534	14	And you don't know how nice that is
506	31535	15	But I do
506	31536	16	[Chorus]
506	31537	17	And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
506	31538	18	I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
506	31539	19	I've been spending the last eight months
506	31540	20	Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
506	31541	21	But on a Wеdnesday in a café, I watched it begin again
506	31542	22	
506	31543	23	[Verse 3]
506	31544	24	You said you nеver met one girl who
506	31545	25	Had as many James Taylor records as you
506	31546	26	But I do
506	31547	27	We tell stories and you don't know why
506	31548	28	I'm coming off a little shy
506	31549	29	But I do
506	31550	30	
506	31551	31	[Chorus]
506	31552	32	But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
506	31553	33	I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
506	31554	34	I've been spending the last eight months
506	31555	35	Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
506	31556	36	But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again
506	31557	37	
506	31558	38	[Instrumental Break]
506	31559	39	
506	31560	40	[Bridge]
506	31561	41	And we walked down the block to my car
506	31562	42	And I almost brought him up
506	31563	43	But you start to talk about the movies
506	31564	44	That your family watches every single Christmas
506	31565	45	And I want to talk about that
506	31566	46	And for the first time, what's past is past
506	31567	47	[Chorus]
506	31568	48	'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
506	31569	49	I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
506	31570	50	I've been spending the last eight months
506	31571	51	Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
506	31572	52	But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again
506	31573	53	
506	31574	54	[Outro]
506	31575	55	On a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again1
507	32870	1	[Verse 1]
507	32871	2	You should've been there
507	32872	3	Should've burst through the door
507	32873	4	With that "Baby, I'm right here" smile
507	32874	5	And it would've felt like
507	32875	6	A million little shining stars that just align
507	32876	7	And I would've been so happy
507	32877	8	
507	32878	9	[Verse 2]
507	32879	10	Christmas lights glisten
507	32880	11	I've got my eye on the door
507	32881	12	Just waiting for you to walk in
507	32882	13	But the time is ticking
507	32883	14	People ask me how I've been
507	32884	15	As I comb back through my memory
507	32885	16	How you said you'd be here
507	32886	17	You said you'd be here
507	32887	18	[Chorus]
507	32888	19	And it was like slow motion
507	32889	20	Standing there in my party dress
507	32890	21	In red lipstick
507	32891	22	With no one to impress
507	32892	23	And they're all laughing
507	32893	24	As I'm looking around the room
507	32894	25	But therе was one thing missing
507	32895	26	And that was the moment I knеw
507	32896	27	
507	32897	28	[Verse 3]
507	32898	29	And the hours pass by
507	32899	30	Now I just wanna be alone
507	32900	31	But your close friends always seem to know
507	32901	32	When there's something really wrong
507	32902	33	So they follow me down the hall
507	32903	34	And there in the bathroom
507	32904	35	I try not to fall apart
507	32905	36	And the sinking feeling starts
507	32906	37	As I say hopelessly
507	32907	38	"He said he'd be here"
507	32908	39	
507	32909	40	[Chorus]
507	32910	41	And it was like slow motion
507	32911	42	Standing there in my party dress
507	32912	43	In red lipstick
507	32913	44	With no one to impress
507	32914	45	And they're all laughing
507	32915	46	And asking me about you
507	32916	47	But there was one thing missing
507	32917	48	And that was the moment I knew
507	32918	49	[Bridge]
507	32919	50	What do you say
507	32920	51	When tears are streaming down your face
507	32921	52	In front of everyone you know?
507	32922	53	And what do you do
507	32923	54	When the one who means the most to you
507	32924	55	Is the one who didn't show?
507	32925	56	
507	32926	57	[Breakdown]
507	32927	58	You should've been here
507	32928	59	And I would've been so happy
507	32929	60	
507	32930	61	[Chorus]
507	32931	62	And it was like slow motion
507	32932	63	Standing there in my party dress
507	32933	64	In red lipstick
507	32934	65	With no one to impress
507	32935	66	And they're all standing around me, singing
507	32936	67	"Happy birthday to you"
507	32937	68	But there was one thing missing
507	32938	69	And that was the moment I knew
507	32939	70	Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
507	32940	71	Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
507	32941	72	
507	32942	73	[Outro]
507	32943	74	You called me later
507	32944	75	And said, "I'm sorry I didn't make it"
507	32945	76	And I said, "I'm sorry, too"
507	32946	77	And that was the moment I knew
508	31645	1	[Verse 1]
508	31646	2	You said it in a simple way
508	31647	3	4 a.m., the second day
508	31648	4	How strange that I don't know you at all
508	31649	5	Stumbled through the long goodbye
508	31650	6	One last kiss, then catch your flight
508	31651	7	Right when I was just about to fall
508	31652	8	
508	31653	9	[Pre-Chorus]
508	31654	10	I told myself, "Don't get attached"
508	31655	11	But in my mind, I play it back
508	31656	12	Spinning faster than the plane that took you
508	31657	13	[Chorus]
508	31658	14	And this is when the feeling sinks in
508	31659	15	I don't wanna miss you like this
508	31660	16	Come back, be here
508	31661	17	Come back, be here
508	31662	18	I guess you're in New York today
508	31663	19	I don't wanna need you this way
508	31664	20	Come back, be here
508	31665	21	Come back, be here
508	31666	22	
508	31667	23	[Verse 2]
508	31668	24	The delicate beginning rush
508	31669	25	The feeling you can know so much
508	31670	26	Without knowing anything at all
508	31671	27	And now that I can put this down
508	31672	28	If I had known what I know now
508	31673	29	I never would've played so nonchalant
508	31674	30	
508	31675	31	[Pre-Chorus]
508	31676	32	Taxi cabs and busy streets
508	31677	33	That never bring you back to me
508	31678	34	I can't help but wish you took me with you
508	31679	35	
508	31680	36	[Chorus]
508	31681	37	And this is when the feeling sinks in
508	31682	38	I don't wanna miss you like this
508	31683	39	Come back, be here
508	31684	40	Come back, be here
508	31685	41	I guess you're in London today
508	31686	42	And I don't wanna need you this way
508	31687	43	Come back, be here
508	31688	44	Come back, be here
508	31689	45	[Post-Chorus]
508	31690	46	Oh, oh
508	31691	47	Oh, oh
508	31692	48	Oh, oh
508	31693	49	
508	31694	50	[Bridge]
508	31695	51	This is falling in love in the cruelest way
508	31696	52	This is falling for you when you are worlds away
508	31697	53	
508	31698	54	[Breakdown]
508	31699	55	In New York, be here
508	31700	56	But you're in London, and I break down
508	31701	57	'Cause it's not fair that you're not around
508	31702	58	
508	31703	59	[Chorus]
508	31704	60	This is when the feeling sinks in
508	31705	61	I don't wanna miss you like this
508	31706	62	Come back, be here
508	31707	63	Come back, be here
508	31708	64	I guess you're in New York today
508	31709	65	And I don't wanna need you this way
508	31710	66	Come back, be here
508	31711	67	Come back, be here
508	31712	68	
508	31713	69	[Post-Chorus]
508	31714	70	Oh, oh, I don't wanna miss you like this
508	31715	71	Oh, oh
508	31716	72	[Outro]
508	31717	73	Come back, be here
508	31718	74	Come back, be here
509	31874	1	[Intro]
509	31875	2	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
509	31876	3	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
509	31877	4	Don’t look at me, you got a girl at home
509	31878	5	And everybody knows that
509	31879	6	
509	31880	7	[Verse 1]
509	31881	8	I don't even know her
509	31882	9	But I feel a responsibility
509	31883	10	To do what's upstanding and right
509	31884	11	It’s kinda like a code, yeah
509	31885	12	And you've been getting closer and closer
509	31886	13	And crossing so many lines
509	31887	14	[Pre-Chorus]
509	31888	15	And it would be a fine proposition
509	31889	16	If I was a stupid girl
509	31890	17	But, honey, I am no one's exception
509	31891	18	This, I have previously learned
509	31892	19	
509	31893	20	[Chorus]
509	31894	21	So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
509	31895	22	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
509	31896	23	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
509	31897	24	And everybody knows that, еverybody knows that
509	31898	25	I see you turn off your phone
509	31899	26	And now you've got mе alone, and I say
509	31900	27	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
509	31901	28	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
509	31902	29	
509	31903	30	[Verse 2]
509	31904	31	I just wanna make sure
509	31905	32	You understand perfectly
509	31906	33	You're the kind of man who makes me sad
509	31907	34	While she waits up
509	31908	35	You chase down the newest thing
509	31909	36	And take for granted what you have
509	31910	37	
509	31911	38	[Pre-Chorus]
509	31912	39	And it would be a fine proposition
509	31913	40	If I was a stupid girl
509	31914	41	And, yeah, I might go with it
509	31915	42	If I hadn’t once been just like her
509	31916	43	[Chorus]
509	31917	44	So don’t look at me, you got a girl at home
509	31918	45	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
509	31919	46	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
509	31920	47	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
509	31921	48	I see you turn off your phone
509	31922	49	And now you’ve got me alone, and I say
509	31923	50	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
509	31924	51	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
509	31925	52	
509	31926	53	[Post-Chorus]
509	31927	54	Oh-oh
509	31928	55	Oh-oh
509	31929	56	
509	31930	57	[Bridge]
509	31931	58	Call a cab, lose my number
509	31932	59	You're about to lose your girl
509	31933	60	Call a cab, lose my number
509	31934	61	Let's consider this lesson learned
509	31935	62	
509	31936	63	[Chorus]
509	31937	64	Don’t look at me, you got a girl at home
509	31938	65	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
509	31939	66	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
509	31940	67	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
509	31941	68	Wanna see you pick up your phone
509	31942	69	And tell her you're coming home
509	31943	70	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
509	31944	71	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
509	31945	72	[Outro]
509	31946	73	It would be a fine proposition
509	31947	74	If I hadn't once been just like her1
510	32589	1	[Verse 1]
510	32590	2	I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
510	32591	3	Busy streets and busy lives
510	32592	4	And all we know is touch and go
510	32593	5	We are alone with our changing minds
510	32594	6	We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
510	32595	7	Or fades in time
510	32596	8	
510	32597	9	[Chorus]
510	32598	10	And I never saw you comin'
510	32599	11	And I'll never be the same
510	32600	12	[Verse 2]
510	32601	13	You come around and the armor falls
510	32602	14	Pierce the room like a cannonball
510	32603	15	Now all we know is don't let go
510	32604	16	We are alone, just you and me
510	32605	17	Up in your room and our slates are clean
510	32606	18	Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
510	32607	19	
510	32608	20	[Pre-Chorus]
510	32609	21	So you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong
510	32610	22	Wе learn to live with the pain, mosaic brokеn hearts
510	32611	23	But this love is brave and wild
510	32612	24	
510	32613	25	[Chorus]
510	32614	26	I never saw you comin'
510	32615	27	And I'll never be the same
510	32616	28	
510	32617	29	[Bridge]
510	32618	30	This is a state of grace
510	32619	31	This is the worthwhile fight
510	32620	32	Love is a ruthless game
510	32621	33	Unless you play it good and right
510	32622	34	These are the hands of fate
510	32623	35	You're my Achilles heel
510	32624	36	This is the golden age
510	32625	37	Of something good and right and real
510	32626	38	[Chorus]
510	32627	39	And I never saw you comin'
510	32628	40	And I'll never be the same
510	32629	41	Oh, I never saw you comin'
510	32630	42	And I'll never be the same
510	32631	43	
510	32632	44	[Outro]
510	32633	45	This is a state of grace
510	32634	46	This is the worthwhile fight
510	32635	47	Love is a ruthless game
510	32636	48	Unless you play it good and right1
511	32374	1	[Verse 1]
511	32375	2	I remember your bare feet down the hallway
511	32376	3	I remember your little laugh
511	32377	4	Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
511	32378	5	I love you to the moon and back
511	32379	6	I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
511	32380	7	Like we had our own secret club
511	32381	8	I remember you dancing before bedtime
511	32382	9	Then jumping on me, waking me up
511	32383	10	I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
511	32384	11	And even the moment I knew
511	32385	12	You fought it hard like an army guy
511	32386	13	Remember I leaned in and whispered to you
511	32387	14	[Chorus]
511	32388	15	"Come on, baby, with me
511	32389	16	We're going to fly away from here
511	32390	17	You were my best four years"
511	32391	18	
511	32392	19	[Verse 2]
511	32393	20	I remember the drive home, when the blind hope
511	32394	21	Turned to crying and screaming, "Why?"
511	32395	22	Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
511	32396	23	About a beautiful boy who died
511	32397	24	And it's about to be Halloween, you could be anything
511	32398	25	You wanted if you were still here
511	32399	26	I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
511	32400	27	And whispered in your ear
511	32401	28	
511	32402	29	[Chorus]
511	32403	30	"Come on, baby, with me
511	32404	31	We're going to fly away from here
511	32405	32	Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray
511	32406	33	We'll just disappear
511	32407	34	Come on, baby, with me
511	32408	35	We're going to fly away from here
511	32409	36	You were my best four years"
511	32410	37	
511	32411	38	[Bridge]
511	32412	39	What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
511	32413	40	And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
511	32414	41	And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
511	32415	42	What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?
511	32416	43	[Chorus]
511	32417	44	Come on, baby, with me
511	32418	45	We're going to fly away from here
511	32419	46	Come on, baby, with me
511	32420	47	We're going to fly away from here
511	32421	48	You were my best four years
511	32422	49	
511	32423	50	[Outro]
511	32424	51	I remember your bare feet down the hallway
511	32425	52	I love you to the moon and back1
512	31576	1	[From the Vault]
512	31577	2	I know I'm probably better off on my own
512	31578	3	Than lovin’ a man who didn't know what he had when he had it
512	31579	4	And I see the permanent damage you did to me
512	31580	5	Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic
512	31581	6	
512	31582	7	[Pre-Chorus]
512	31583	8	I wish it wasn't 4 AM, standing in the mirror
512	31584	9	Saying to myself, "You know you had to do it"
512	31585	10	I know the bravest thing I ever did was run
512	31586	11	[Chorus]
512	31587	12	Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
512	31588	13	But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
512	31589	14	And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
512	31590	15	But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
512	31591	16	A better man
512	31592	17	
512	31593	18	[Verse 2]
512	31594	19	I know I’m probably better off all alone
512	31595	20	Than needing a man who could change his mind
512	31596	21	At any given minute
512	31597	22	And it was always on your terms
512	31598	23	I waited on every careless word
512	31599	24	Hoping they might turn sweet again
512	31600	25	Like it was in the beginning
512	31601	26	
512	31602	27	[Pre-Chorus]
512	31603	28	But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now
512	31604	29	Talking down to me like I'd always be around
512	31605	30	Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
512	31606	31	Oh, you never thought I'd run
512	31607	32	
512	31608	33	[Chorus]
512	31609	34	Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
512	31610	35	But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
512	31611	36	And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand
512	31612	37	But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
512	31613	38	A better man
512	31614	39	[Bridge]
512	31615	40	I hold onto this pride because these days it's all I have
512	31616	41	And I gave to you my best
512	31617	42	And we both know you can't say that
512	31618	43	I wish you were a better man
512	31619	44	I wonder what we would've become
512	31620	45	If you were a better man
512	31621	46	We might still be in love
512	31622	47	If you were a better man
512	31623	48	You would've been the one
512	31624	49	If you were a better man
512	31625	50	Yeah, yeah
512	31626	51	
512	31627	52	[Chorus]
512	31628	53	Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
512	31629	54	But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
512	31630	55	And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand
512	31631	56	But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
512	31632	57	A better man
512	31633	58	(Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again)
512	31634	59	We might still be in love, if you were a better man
512	31635	60	(But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man)
512	31636	61	Yeah, yeah
512	31637	62	I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
512	31638	63	But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
512	31639	64	A better man
512	31640	65	[Outro]
512	31641	66	We might still be in love
512	31642	67	If you were a better man
512	31643	68	You would've been the one
512	31644	69	If you were a better man2
513	32261	1	[From the Vault]
513	32262	2	They tell you while you're young
513	32263	3	"Girls, go out and have your fun"
513	32264	4	Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it
513	32265	5	Criticize the way you fly
513	32266	6	When you're soaring through the sky
513	32267	7	Shoot you down and then they sigh
513	32268	8	And say, "She looks like she's been through it"
513	32269	9	
513	32270	10	[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
513	32271	11	Lord, what will become of me
513	32272	12	Once I've lost my novelty?
513	32273	13	[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
513	32274	14	I've had too much to drink tonight
513	32275	15	And I know it's sad, but this is what I think about
513	32276	16	And I wake up in the middle of the night
513	32277	17	It's like I can feel time moving
513	32278	18	How can a person know everythin' at eighteen
513	32279	19	But nothin' at twenty-two?
513	32280	20	And will you still want me
513	32281	21	When I'm nothing new?
513	32282	22	[Verse 2: Phoebe Bridgers]
513	32283	23	How long will it be cute, all this cryin' in my room?
513	32284	24	When you can't blame it on my youth
513	32285	25	And roll your eyes with affection
513	32286	26	And my cheeks are growing tired
513	32287	27	From turning red and faking smiles
513	32288	28	Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention?
513	32289	29	
513	32290	30	[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Phoebe Bridgers]
513	32291	31	And someone else lights up the room (Ah)
513	32292	32	People love an ingénue (Ah)
513	32293	33	
513	32294	34	[Chorus: Phoebe Bridgers, Taylor Swift]
513	32295	35	I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
513	32296	36	How did I go from growin' up to breaking down?
513	32297	37	And I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night
513	32298	38	It's like I can feel time movin'
513	32299	39	How can a person know everything at eighteen
513	32300	40	But nothing at twenty-two?
513	32301	41	And will you still want me
513	32302	42	When I'm nothing new?
513	32303	43	[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Both, Phoebe Bridgers]
513	32304	44	I know someday I'm gonna meet her, it's a fever dream
513	32305	45	The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen
513	32306	46	She'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me
513	32307	47	I'll say I'm happy for her, then I'll cry myself to sleep
513	32308	48	Oh, woah, oh (Oh)
513	32309	49	Oh, woah, oh, woah, oh (Oh)
513	32310	50	
513	32311	51	[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Phoebe Bridgers, Both]
513	32312	52	I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
513	32313	53	But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out
513	32314	54	I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night
513	32315	55	And I can feel time moving
513	32316	56	How can a person know everything at eighteen
513	32317	57	But nothing at twenty-two?
513	32318	58	And will you still want me
513	32319	59	Will you still want me
513	32320	60	Will you still want me
513	32321	61	When I'm nothing new?4
514	31458	1	[From the Vault]
514	31459	2	What about your promises, promises?
514	31460	3	What about your promises, promises, promises? (No)
514	31461	4	
514	31462	5	[Verse 1]
514	31463	6	What a shame
514	31464	7	Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
514	31465	8	Big mistake, you broke the sweetest promise
514	31466	9	That you never should have made
514	31467	10	
514	31468	11	[Pre-Chorus]
514	31469	12	I'm here on the kitchen floor
514	31470	13	You call, but I won't hear it
514	31471	14	You said, "No one else"
514	31472	15	How could you do this, babe? (What about your promises, promises?)
514	31473	16	[Chorus]
514	31474	17	You really blew this, babe
514	31475	18	We ain't getting through this one, babe
514	31476	19	This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (This is the last time, this is the last time)
514	31477	20	This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
514	31478	21	(What about your promises, promises, promises?)
514	31479	22	
514	31480	23	[Verse 2]
514	31481	24	What a waste
514	31482	25	Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
514	31483	26	And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
514	31484	27	Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe
514	31485	28	
514	31486	29	[Pre-Chorus]
514	31487	30	I break down every time you call
514	31488	31	We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
514	31489	32	We said, "No one else"
514	31490	33	How could you do this, babe? (What about your promises, promises?)
514	31491	34	
514	31492	35	[Chorus]
514	31493	36	You really blew this, babe
514	31494	37	We ain't getting through this one, babe
514	31495	38	This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (This is the last time, this is the last time)
514	31496	39	This is the last time I'll ever call you
514	31497	40	
514	31498	41	[Bridge]
514	31499	42	Since you admitted it, I keep picturing
514	31500	43	Her lips on your neck, I can't unsee it
514	31501	44	I hate that because of you, I can't love you, babe
514	31502	45	[Breakdown]
514	31503	46	What a shame, didn't want to be the one that got away
514	31504	47	How could you do this, babe? (Babe)
514	31505	48	
514	31506	49	[Chorus]
514	31507	50	You really blew this, babe (Babe)
514	31508	51	We ain't getting through this one, babe (Babe)
514	31509	52	This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (This is the last time, this is the last time)
514	31510	53	This is the last time I'll ever call you
514	31511	54	
514	31512	55	[Outro]
514	31513	56	I'm here on the kitchen floor, you call but I won't hear it
514	31514	57	You said, "No one else"
514	31515	58	We ain't getting through this one, babe
514	31516	59	I break down every time you call
514	31517	60	We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
514	31518	61	We said, "No one else"
514	31519	62	This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (Babe)
514	31520	63	(What about your promises, promises, promises?)2
515	32199	1	[From the Vault]
515	32200	2	I know that you like me
515	32201	3	And it's kinda frightenin' standin' here waitin', waitin'
515	32202	4	And I became hypnotized
515	32203	5	By freckles and bright eyes, tongue-tied
515	32204	6	
515	32205	7	[Pre-Chorus]
515	32206	8	But now, you're so far away and I'm down
515	32207	9	Feelin' like a face in the crowd
515	32208	10	I'm reachin' for you, terrified
515	32209	11	[Chorus]
515	32210	12	'Cause you could be the one that I love
515	32211	13	I could be the one that you dream of
515	32212	14	A message in a bottle is all I can do
515	32213	15	Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
515	32214	16	You could be the one that I keep, and I
515	32215	17	I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
515	32216	18	A mеssage in a bottle is all I can do
515	32217	19	Standin' herе, hopin' it gets to you
515	32218	20	
515	32219	21	[Verse 2]
515	32220	22	These days I'm restless
515	32221	23	Workdays are endless, look how you made me, made me
515	32222	24	But time moves faster
515	32223	25	Replayin' your laughter, disaster
515	32224	26	
515	32225	27	[Pre-Chorus]
515	32226	28	'Cause now, you're so far away and I'm down
515	32227	29	Feelin' like a face in the crowd
515	32228	30	I'm reachin' for you, terrified, 'cause
515	32229	31	
515	32230	32	[Chorus]
515	32231	33	'Cause you could be the one that I love
515	32232	34	I could be the one that you dream of
515	32233	35	A message in a bottle is all I can do
515	32234	36	Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (It gets to you)
515	32235	37	You could be the one that I keep, and I (Ah)
515	32236	38	I could be the reason you can't sleep at night (At)
515	32237	39	A message in a bottle is all I can do
515	32238	40	Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
515	32239	41	[Bridge]
515	32240	42	How is it in London? (London)
515	32241	43	Where were you while I'm wonderin' (Wonderin')
515	32242	44	If I'll ever see you again?
515	32243	45	You could be the one that I love, mm
515	32244	46	And now I'm standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
515	32245	47	
515	32246	48	[Chorus]
515	32247	49	'Cause you could be the one that I love (Yeah, yeah)
515	32248	50	I could be the one that you dream of (Of)

515	32255	57	
515	32256	58	[Outro]
515	32257	59	(Love) You could be the one that I love
515	32258	60	(Love) You could be the one that I love
515	32259	61	(Love) My love
515	32260	62	And now I'm standin' here, hopin' this gets to you
516	32052	1	[From the Vault]
516	32053	2	3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine
516	32054	3	Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
516	32055	4	And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
516	32056	5	And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh
516	32057	6	
516	32058	7	[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
516	32059	8	Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
516	32060	9	Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
516	32061	10	Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
516	32062	11	And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of
516	32063	12	[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
516	32064	13	But now that we're done and it's over
516	32065	14	I bet you couldn't believe
516	32066	15	When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
516	32067	16	And I bet you think about me
516	32068	17	
516	32069	18	[Verse 3: Taylor Swift]
516	32070	19	You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
516	32071	20	Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
516	32072	21	I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
516	32073	22	Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills
516	32074	23	
516	32075	24	[Verse 4: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
516	32076	25	But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
516	32077	26	And you and I fell like an early spring snow
516	32078	27	But reality crept in, you said we're too different
516	32079	28	You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes
516	32080	29	
516	32081	30	[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
516	32082	31	Mr. Superior Thinkin'
516	32083	32	Do you have all the space that you need?
516	32084	33	I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy
516	32085	34	And I bet you think about me
516	32086	35	
516	32087	36	[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
516	32088	37	I bet you think about me, yes
516	32089	38	I bet you think about me
516	32090	39	[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
516	32091	40	Oh, block it all out
516	32092	41	The voices so loud, sayin'
516	32093	42	"Why did you let her go?"
516	32094	43	Does it make you feel sad
516	32095	44	That the love that you're lookin' for
516	32096	45	Is the love that you had?
516	32097	46	
516	32098	47	[Verse 5: Taylor Swift]
516	32099	48	Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul
516	32100	49	Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
516	32101	50	Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free
516	32102	51	Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me
516	32103	52	
516	32104	53	[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
516	32105	54	But now that we're done and it's over
516	32106	55	I bet it's hard to believe
516	32107	56	But it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
516	32108	57	And, yeah, I bet you think about me
516	32109	58	
516	32110	59	[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
516	32111	60	I bet you think about me, yes
516	32112	61	I bet you think about me
516	32113	62	
516	32114	63	[Outro: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
516	32115	64	I bet you think about me when you're out
516	32116	65	At your cool indie music concerts every week
516	32117	66	I bet you think about me in your house
516	32118	67	With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch
516	32119	68	I bet you think about me when you say
516	32120	69	"Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me"
516	32121	70	I bet you think about me
517	31806	1	[From the Vault]
517	31807	2	He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
517	31808	3	He says, "Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?"
517	31809	4	He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
517	31810	5	He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity
517	31811	6	
517	31812	7	[Pre-Chorus]
517	31813	8	I call, just checking up on him
517	31814	9	He's up, 3 AM, pacing
517	31815	10	He says, "It's not just a phase I'm in"
517	31816	11	My voice comes out begging
517	31817	12	[Chorus]
517	31818	13	All this time, I didn't know
517	31819	14	You were breaking down
517	31820	15	I'd fall to pieces on the floor
517	31821	16	If you weren't around
517	31822	17	Too young to know it gets better
517	31823	18	I'll be summer sun for you forever
517	31824	19	Forever winter if you go
517	31825	20	
517	31826	21	[Verse 2]
517	31827	22	He seems fine most of the time
517	31828	23	Forcing smiles and never minds
517	31829	24	His laugh is a symphony
517	31830	25	When the lights go out, it's hard to breathe
517	31831	26	I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
517	31832	27	Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead
517	31833	28	
517	31834	29	[Pre-Chorus]
517	31835	30	I call, just checking up on him
517	31836	31	He's up, 5 AM, wasted
517	31837	32	Long gone, not even listening
517	31838	33	My voice comes out screaming
517	31839	34	
517	31840	35	[Chorus]
517	31841	36	All this time, I didn't know
517	31842	37	You were breaking down
517	31843	38	I'd fall to pieces on the floor
517	31844	39	If you weren't around
517	31845	40	Too young to know it gets better
517	31846	41	I'll be summer sun for you forever
517	31847	42	Forever winter if you go
517	31848	43	[Bridge]
517	31849	44	If I was standing there in your apartment
517	31850	45	I'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it
517	31851	46	I'd say I love you even at your darkest and
517	31852	47	Please don't go
517	31853	48	
517	31854	49	[Chorus]
517	31855	50	I didn't know
517	31856	51	You were breaking down
517	31857	52	I'd fall to pieces on the floor
517	31858	53	If you weren't around
517	31859	54	Too young to know it gets better
517	31860	55	I'll be summer sun for you forever
517	31861	56	Forever winter if you go
517	31862	57	
517	31863	58	[Post-Chorus]
517	31864	59	I'll be your summer sun forever
517	31865	60	At 3 AM, pacing
517	31866	61	All this time, I didn't know
517	31867	62	At 5 AM, wasted
517	31868	63	I'd be in pieces on the floor
517	31869	64	Forever winter if you go
517	31870	65	
517	31871	66	[Outro]
517	31872	67	He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
517	31873	68	I say, "Believe in one thing, I won't go away"4
518	32426	1	[From the Vault]
518	32427	2	One, two, three, four
518	32428	3	
518	32429	4	[Verse 1: Taylor Swift with Ed Sheeran]
518	32430	5	Give me the keys, I'll bring the car back around
518	32431	6	We shouldn't be in this town
518	32432	7	And my so-called friends, they don't know
518	32433	8	I'd drive away before I let you go
518	32434	9	So give me a reason and don't say no, no
518	32435	10	There's a chain 'round your throat, piece of paper where I wrote
518	32436	11	"I'll wait for you"
518	32437	12	There's a key on the chain, there's a picture in a frame
518	32438	13	Take it with you
518	32439	14	[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
518	32440	15	And run, like you'd run from the law
518	32441	16	Darling, let's run
518	32442	17	Run from it all
518	32443	18	We can go where our eyes can take us
518	32444	19	Go where no one else is, run
518	32445	20	Ooh, we'll run
518	32446	21	Ooh, we'll run
518	32447	22	Ooh, we'll run
518	32448	23	
518	32449	24	[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran & Both]
518	32450	25	So you laugh like a child
518	32451	26	And I'll sing like no one cares
518	32452	27	No one to be, no one to tell
518	32453	28	I could see this view a hundred times
518	32454	29	Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
518	32455	30	So give me a reason and don't say no, no
518	32456	31	And the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket
518	32457	32	Since I gave it to you
518	32458	33	There's a heart on your sleeve
518	32459	34	I'll take it when I leave
518	32460	35	And hold it for you
518	32461	36	
518	32462	37	[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
518	32463	38	And run, like you'd run from the law
518	32464	39	Darling, let's run
518	32465	40	Run from it all
518	32466	41	We can go like they're trying to chase us
518	32467	42	Go where no one else is, run
518	32468	43	Ooh, we'll run
518	32469	44	Ooh, we'll run
518	32470	45	Ooh, we'll run
518	32471	46	[Bridge: Ed Sheeran & Taylor Swift]
518	32472	47	There's been this hole in my heart
518	32473	48	This thing was a shot in the dark
518	32474	49	Say you'll never let 'em tear us apart
518	32475	50	And I'll hold onto you while we run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
518	32476	51	
518	32477	52	[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
518	32478	53	Like you'd run from the law (And we run, and we run, and we run)
518	32479	54	Darling, let's run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
518	32480	55	Run from it all (And we run, and we run, and we run)
518	32481	56	We can go where our eyes can take us (And we run, and we run, and we run)
518	32482	57	Go where no one else is, run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
518	32483	58	Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
518	32484	59	Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
518	32485	60	Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
518	32486	61	Ooh, and we'll run2
519	32947	1	[From the Vault]
519	32948	2	I wish I could fly
519	32949	3	I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
519	32950	4	I'd write this in the sky
519	32951	5	I miss you like it was the very first night
519	32952	6	
519	32953	7	[Verse 1]
519	32954	8	And so it goes
519	32955	9	Every weekend, this same party
519	32956	10	I never go alone
519	32957	11	And I don't seem broken-hearted
519	32958	12	My friends all say they know
519	32959	13	Everything I'm going through
519	32960	14	I drive down different roads
519	32961	15	But they all lead back to you
519	32962	16	[Pre-Chorus]
519	32963	17	'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
519	32964	18	They weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell
519	32965	19	Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
519	32966	20	They don't know how much I miss you
519	32967	21	
519	32968	22	[Chorus]
519	32969	23	I wish I could fly
519	32970	24	I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
519	32971	25	I'd write this in the sky
519	32972	26	I miss you like it was the very first night
519	32973	27	
519	32974	28	[Verse 2]
519	32975	29	And so it was
519	32976	30	We never saw it coming
519	32977	31	Not trying to fall in love
519	32978	32	But we did like children running
519	32979	33	Back then, we didn't know
519	32980	34	We were built to fall apart
519	32981	35	We broke the status quo
519	32982	36	Then we broke each other's hearts
519	32983	37	
519	32984	38	[Pre-Chorus]
519	32985	39	But don't forget about the night out in L.A
519	32986	40	Dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway
519	32987	41	No one knows about the words that we whispered
519	32988	42	No one knows how much I miss you
519	32989	43	[Chorus]
519	32990	44	I wish I could fly
519	32991	45	I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
519	32992	46	I'd write this in the sky

519	33004	58	
519	33005	59	[Bridge]
519	33006	60	I remember the night at the hotel
519	33007	61	I was ridin' in the car when we both fell
519	33008	62	I'm the one on the phone as you whisper
519	33009	63	"Do you know how much I miss you?"
519	33010	64	
519	33011	65	[Breakdown]
519	33012	66	I wish that we could go back in time
519	33013	67	And I'd say to you

521	31451	1	[]
521	31452	2	It was all over the place
521	31453	3	A fractured mosaic of feelings that somehow all fit together in the end
521	31454	4	Happy, free, confused, lonely, devastated, euphoric, wild
521	31455	5	And tortured by memories past
521	31456	6	These are the original thirty songs that were meant for Red
521	31457	7	I love you guys
546	35991	1	[Verse 1]
546	35992	2	Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
546	35993	3	Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
546	35994	4	But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
546	35995	5	Holdin' him for ransom, some
546	35996	6	Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
546	35997	7	Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
546	35998	8	I see nothing better, I keep him forever
546	35999	9	Like a vendetta-ta
546	36000	10	
546	36001	11	[Pre-Chorus]
546	36002	12	I, I, I see how this is gon' go
546	36003	13	Touch me and you'll never be alone
546	36004	14	I-Island breeze and lights down low
546	36005	15	No one has to know
546	36006	16	[Chorus]
546	36007	17	In the middle of the night, in my dreams
546	36008	18	You should see the things we do, baby

546	36012	22	
546	36013	23	[Verse 2]
546	36014	24	Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
546	36015	25	Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
546	36016	26	But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
546	36017	27	We'll move to an island, and
546	36018	28	And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
546	36019	29	Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
546	36020	30	I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
546	36021	31	Never be the same now, now
546	36022	32	
546	36023	33	[Pre-Chorus]
546	36024	34	I, I, I see how this is gon' go
546	36025	35	Touch me and you'll never be alone

547	35211	42	Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
547	35212	43	Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
547	35213	44	Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep
547	35214	45	The truth is, it’s easier to ignore it, believe me
547	35215	46	Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
547	35216	47	And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
547	35217	48	For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
547	35218	49	For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
547	35219	50	I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
547	35220	51	After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
547	35221	52	I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one

553	35376	20	And I'm so furious
553	35377	21	At you for making me feel this way
553	35378	22	But what can I say?
553	35379	23	You're gorgeous
553	35380	24	
553	35381	25	[Verse 2]
553	35382	26	You should take it as a compliment
553	35383	27	That I'm talking to everyone here but you (But you, but you)
553	35384	28	And you should think about the consequence
553	35385	29	Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)
553	35386	30	If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
553	35387	31	But if you're single that's honestly worse
553	35388	32	'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)
553	35389	33	
553	35390	34	[Pre-Chorus]

553	35405	49	And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
553	35406	50	You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
553	35407	51	There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
553	35408	52	Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Yeugh) alone
553	35409	53	Unless, you wanna come along? (Oh)

554	35269	2	No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
554	35270	3	
554	35271	4	[Verse 1]
554	35272	5	It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
554	35273	6	I struck a match and blew your mind
554	35274	7	But I didn't mean it and you didn’t see it
554	35275	8	The ties were black, the lies were white
554	35276	9	In shades of gray in candlelight
554	35277	10	I wanted to leave him, I needed a reason
554	35278	11	[Pre-Chorus]
554	35279	12	"X" marks the spot where we fell apart
554	35280	13	He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
554	35281	14	I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
554	35282	15	We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh!)
554	35283	16	
554	35284	17	[Chorus]
554	35285	18	You were drivin' the getaway car
554	35286	19	We were flyin’, but we'd never get far
554	35287	20	Don't pretend it's such a mystery
554	35288	21	Think about the place where you first met me
554	35289	22	Ridin' in a getaway car
554	35290	23	There were sirens in the beat of your heart
554	35291	24	Should've known I'd be the first to leave
554	35292	25	Think about the place where you first met me
554	35293	26	In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
554	35294	27	No, they never get far, oh-oh-ah
554	35295	28	No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
554	35296	29	
554	35297	30	[Verse 2]
554	35298	31	It was the great escape, the prison break
554	35299	32	The light of freedom on my face
554	35300	33	But you weren't thinkin’ and I was just drinkin’
554	35301	34	While he was runnin' after us, I was screamin’, "Go, go, go!"
554	35302	35	But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
554	35303	36	And a circus ain't a love story and now we're both sorry
554	35304	37	(We’re both sorry)
554	35305	38	[Pre-Chorus]
554	35306	39	"X" marks the spot where we fell apart
554	35307	40	He poisoned the well, every man for himself
554	35308	41	I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
554	35309	42	It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (Oh!)
554	35310	43	
554	35311	44	[Chorus]
554	35312	45	You were drivin' the getaway car

554	35323	56	
554	35324	57	[Bridge]
554	35325	58	We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (Oh-oh)
554	35326	59	Until I switched to the other side, to the other side
554	35327	60	It's no surprise I turned you in (Oh-oh)
554	35328	61	'Cause us traitors never win

554	35330	63	[Breakdown]
554	35331	64	I'm in a getaway car
554	35332	65	I left you in a motel bar
554	35333	66	Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
554	35334	67	That was the last time you ever saw me (Oh!)
554	35335	68	[Chorus]
554	35336	69	Drivin' the getaway car
554	35337	70	We were flyin', but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)

555	35566	2	I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own
555	35567	3	I made up my mind, I'm better off bein' alone

556	34859	16	And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
556	34860	17	People started talking, putting us through our paces
556	34861	18	I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
556	34862	19	I had a bad feeling

556	34877	34	So, baby, can we dance
556	34878	35	Oh, through an avalanche? And
556	34879	36	Say, say that we got it
556	34880	37	I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted

557	35126	36	All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
557	35127	37	My hands are shaking from all this
557	35128	38	Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah
557	35129	39	[Chorus]
557	35130	40	Say my name and everything just stops
557	35131	41	I don't want you like a best friend
557	35132	42	Only bought this dress so you could take it off
557	35133	43	Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
557	35134	44	Carve your name into my bedpost
557	35135	45	'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
557	35136	46	Only bought this dress so you could take it off

557	35145	55	[Bridge]
557	35146	56	Flashback when you met me, your buzzcut and my hair bleached
557	35147	57	Even in my worst times, you could see the best in me
557	35148	58	Flashback to my mistakes, my rebounds, my earthquakes
557	35149	59	Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me
557	35150	60	And I woke up just in time, now I wake up by your side
557	35151	61	My one and only, my lifeline
557	35152	62	I woke up just in time, now I wake up by your side
557	35153	63	My hands shake, I can't explain this
557	35154	64	Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah
557	35155	65	[Chorus]
557	35156	66	Say my name and everything just stops

557	35160	70	Carve your name into my bedpost
557	35161	71	’Cause I don’t want you like a best friend
557	35162	72	Only bought this dress so you could take it off
557	35163	73	Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
557	35164	74	
557	35165	75	[Outro]
557	35166	76	There is an indentation in the shape of you
557	35167	77	Only bought this dress so you could take it off
557	35168	78	You made your mark on me, golden tattoo
557	35169	79	Only bought this dress so you could take it off5
558	35889	1	[Verse 1]
558	35890	2	It was so nice throwing big parties
558	35891	3	Jump into the pool from the balcony
558	35892	4	Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
558	35893	5	And there are no rules when you show up here
558	35894	6	Bass beat rattling the chandelier
558	35895	7	Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year
558	35896	8	
558	35897	9	[Pre-Chorus]
558	35898	10	So, why'd you have to rain on my parade?
558	35899	11	I'm shaking my head and locking the gates
558	35900	12	[Chorus]
558	35901	13	This is why we can't have nice things, darling
558	35902	14	Because you break them, I had to take them away
558	35903	15	This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh)
558	35904	16	Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
558	35905	17	This is why we can't have nice things
558	35906	18	
558	35907	19	[Verse 2]
558	35908	20	It was so nice being friends again
558	35909	21	There I was, giving you a second chance
558	35910	22	But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
558	35911	23	And therein lies the issue, friends don't try to trick you
558	35912	24	Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
558	35913	25	And so I took an axe to a mended fence
558	35914	26	
558	35915	27	[Pre-Chorus]
558	35916	28	But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (Mm-mm)
558	35917	29	If only you weren't so shady
558	35918	30	[Chorus]
558	35919	31	This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Yeah)
558	35920	32	Because you break them, I had to take them away
558	35921	33	This is why we can't have nice (Nice things) things (Baby), honey
558	35922	34	Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
558	35923	35	This is why we can't have—
558	35924	36	[Bridge]
558	35925	37	Here's a toast to my real friends
558	35926	38	They don't care about the he-said, she-said
558	35927	39	And here's to my baby
558	35928	40	He ain't reading what they call me lately
558	35929	41	And here's to my mama
558	35930	42	Had to listen to all this drama
558	35931	43	And here's to you
558	35932	44	'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
558	35933	45	Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face
558	35934	46	[Chorus]
558	35935	47	This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Darling)
558	35936	48	Because you break them, I had to take them away
558	35937	49	This is why we can't have nice (Uh-uh) things (Oh, no), honey (Baby, oh)
558	35938	50	Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
558	35939	51	This is why we can't have nice things, darling
558	35940	52	(And here's to my real friends)
558	35941	53	Because you break them, I had to take them
558	35942	54	(And here's to my baby)
558	35943	55	Nice things, honey
558	35944	56	(They didn't care about that he-said, she-said)
558	35945	57	Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
558	35946	58	This is why we can't have nice things5
559	34761	1	[Verse 1]
559	34762	2	My castle crumbled overnight
559	34763	3	I brought a knife to a gunfight
559	34764	4	They took the crown, but it's alright
559	34765	5	All the liars are calling me one
559	34766	6	Nobody's heard from me for months
559	34767	7	I'm doin' better than I ever was

559	34773	13	I'm the one he's walking to
559	34774	14	So call it what you want, yeah
559	34775	15	Call it what you want to
559	34776	16	My baby's fly like a jet stream

559	34782	22	All my flowers grew back as thorns
559	34783	23	Windows boarded up after the storm
559	34784	24	He built a fire just to keep me warm
559	34785	25	All the drama queens taking swings
559	34786	26	All the jokers dressing up as kings
559	34787	27	They fade to nothing when I look at him
559	34788	28	And I know I make the same mistakes every time
559	34789	29	Bridges burn, I never learn
559	34790	30	At least I did one thing right
559	34791	31	I did one thing right
559	34792	32	I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers
559	34793	33	Trust him like a brother

559	34811	51	Chain 'round my neck
559	34812	52	Not because he owns me
559	34813	53	But 'cause he really knows me
559	34814	54	Which is more than they can say, I
559	34815	55	I recall late November
559	34816	56	Holding my breath, slowly, I said
559	34817	57	"You don't need to save me

563	35947	1	[Poem]
563	35948	2	Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated
563	35949	3	as a child with sidewalk chalk
563	35950	4	When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away
563	35951	5	with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends
563	35952	6	
563	35953	7	When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink
563	35954	8	forming the words of a thousand voices
563	35955	9	Echoes she heard even in her sleep:
563	35956	10	"Whatever you say, it is not right."
563	35957	11	"Whatever you do, it is not enough."
563	35958	12	"Your kindness is fake."
563	35959	13	"Your pain is manipulative."
563	35960	14	When she lay there on the ground,
563	35961	15	She dreamed of time machines and revenge
563	35962	16	and a love that was really something,
563	35963	17	Not just the idea of something.
563	35964	18	
563	35965	19	When she finally rose, she rose slowly
563	35966	20	Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies
563	35967	21	Wary of phone calls and promises,
563	35968	22	Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes
563	35969	23	
563	35970	24	When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness
563	35971	25	Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck
563	35972	26	Bathed in her brokenness
563	35973	27	Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor
563	35974	28	she never knew she needed
563	35975	29	Standing broad-shouldered next to her
563	35976	30	was a love that was really something,
563	35977	31	not just the idea of something.
563	35978	32	
563	35979	33	When she turned to go home,
563	35980	34	She heard the echoes of new words
563	35981	35	"May your heart remain breakable
563	35982	36	But never by the same hand twice"
563	35983	37	And even louder:
563	35984	38	"without your past,
563	35985	39	you could never have arrived-
563	35986	40	so wondrously and brutally,
563	35987	41	By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance
563	35988	42	...here."
563	35989	43	And in the death of her reputation,
563	35990	44	She felt truly alive.2
564	35513	1	[Poem]
564	35514	2	You bite your nails,
564	35515	3	And laugh when you're nervous.
564	35516	4	You promise people the world,
564	35517	5	because that's what they want from you.
564	35518	6	You like giving them what they want...
564	35519	7	But darling, you need to stop,
564	35520	8	
564	35521	9	If you're anything like me,
564	35522	10	You knock on wood every time you make plans.
564	35523	11	You cross your fingers, hold your breath,
564	35524	12	Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes
564	35525	13	Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck.
564	35526	14	Rest In Peace, to your naive bravado...
564	35527	15	If life gets too good now,
564	35528	16	Darling, it scares you.
564	35529	17	If you're anything like me,
564	35530	18	You never wanted to lock your door,
564	35531	19	Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer
564	35532	20	Didn't want to face the you you don't know anymore
564	35533	21	For fear she was much better before...
564	35534	22	But Darling, now you have to.
564	35535	23	
564	35536	24	If you're anything like me,
564	35537	25	There's a justice system in your head
564	35538	26	For names you'll never speak again,
564	35539	27	And you make your ruthless rulings.
564	35540	28	Each new enemy turns to steel
564	35541	29	They become the bars that confine you,
564	35542	30	In your own little golden prison cell...
564	35543	31	But Darling, there is where you meet yourself.
564	35544	32	
564	35545	33	If you're anything like me
564	35546	34	You've grown to hate your pride
564	35547	35	To love your thighs
564	35548	36	And no amount of friends at 25
564	35549	37	Will fill the empty seats
564	35550	38	At the lunch tables of your past
564	35551	39	The teams that picked you last...
564	35552	40	But Darling, you keep trying.
564	35553	41	
564	35554	42	If you're anything like me,
564	35555	43	You couldn't recognize the face of your love
564	35556	44	Until they stripped you of your shiny paint
564	35557	45	Threw your victory flag away
564	35558	46	And you saw the ones who wanted you anyway...
564	35559	47	Darling, later on you will thank your stars
564	35560	48	for that frightful day.
564	35561	49	If you're anything like me,
564	35562	50	I'm sorry.
564	35563	51	
564	35564	52	But Darling, it's going to be okay.
579	37823	1	[Intro]
579	37824	2	Oh-oh, oh-oh
579	37825	3	Oh-oh, oh-oh
579	37826	4	
579	37827	5	[Verse 1]
579	37828	6	You were in college working part time waitin' tables
579	37829	7	Left a small town, never looked back
579	37830	8	I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
579	37831	9	Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts
579	37832	10	
579	37833	11	[Pre-Chorus]
579	37834	12	I say, "Can you believe it?"
579	37835	13	As we're lyin' on the couch
579	37836	14	The moment I could see it
579	37837	15	Yes, yes, I can see it now
579	37838	16	[Chorus]
579	37839	17	Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
579	37840	18	You put your arm around me for the first time
579	37841	19	You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
579	37842	20	You are the best thing that's ever been mine
579	37843	21	
579	37844	22	[Verse 2]
579	37845	23	Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
579	37846	24	And there's a drawer of my things at your place
579	37847	25	You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
579	37848	26	You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
579	37849	27	
579	37850	28	[Pre-Chorus]
579	37851	29	But we got bills to pay
579	37852	30	We got nothing figured out
579	37853	31	When it was hard to take
579	37854	32	Yes, yes, this is what I thought about
579	37855	33	
579	37856	34	[Chorus]
579	37857	35	Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
579	37858	36	You put your arm around me for the first time
579	37859	37	You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
579	37860	38	You are the best thing that's ever been mine
579	37861	39	Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
579	37862	40	You saw me start to believe for the first time
579	37863	41	You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
579	37864	42	You are the best thing that's ever been mine
579	37865	43	[Post-Chorus]
579	37866	44	Oh-oh, oh-oh
579	37867	45	
579	37868	46	[Bridge]
579	37869	47	And I remember that fight, 2:30AM
579	37870	48	As everything was slipping right out of our hands
579	37871	49	I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
579	37872	50	Braced myself for the goodbye
579	37873	51	'Cause that's all I've ever known
579	37874	52	Then you took me by surprise
579	37875	53	You said, "I'll never leave you alone"
579	37876	54	
579	37877	55	[Chorus]
579	37878	56	You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water
579	37879	57	And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
579	37880	58	I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
579	37881	59	She is the best thing that's ever been mine"
579	37882	60	
579	37883	61	[Post-Chorus]
579	37884	62	Hold on, make it last
579	37885	63	Hold on, never turn back
579	37886	64	(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (Make it last)
579	37887	65	(Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine (Hold on)
579	37888	66	
579	37889	67	[Outro]
579	37890	68	Yes, yes, do you believe it? (Hold on)
579	37891	69	Yes, yes, we're gonna make it now (Hold on)
579	37892	70	Yes, yes, I can see it
579	37893	71	Yes, yes, I can see it now4
580	38084	1	[Verse 1]
580	38085	2	The way you move is like a full on rainstorm and I'm a house of cards
580	38086	3	You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'
580	38087	4	But I kinda know that I won't get far
580	38088	5	And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch
580	38089	6	Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of
580	38090	7	
580	38091	8	[Chorus]
580	38092	9	Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
580	38093	10	Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
580	38094	11	'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
580	38095	12	Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
580	38096	13	Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
580	38097	14	'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
580	38098	15	[Verse 2]
580	38099	16	My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea
580	38100	17	You touch me once and it's really somethin'
580	38101	18	You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
580	38102	19	I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
580	38103	20	But with you, I know it's no good
580	38104	21	And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would
580	38105	22	
580	38106	23	[Chorus]
580	38107	24	Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
580	38108	25	Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
580	38109	26	'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
580	38110	27	Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
580	38111	28	Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
580	38112	29	'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
580	38113	30	
580	38114	31	[Bridge]
580	38115	32	I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
580	38116	33	Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
580	38117	34	And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?
580	38118	35	I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show
580	38119	36	
580	38120	37	[Chorus]
580	38121	38	Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
580	38122	39	Kiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain
580	38123	40	'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
580	38124	41	Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
580	38125	42	Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
580	38126	43	'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
580	38127	44	[Outro]
580	38128	45	And the sparks fly
580	38129	46	Oh, baby, smile
580	38130	47	And the sparks fly4
581	37020	1	[Verse 1]
581	37021	2	I'm so glad you made time to see me
581	37022	3	How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
581	37023	4	I haven't seen them in a while
581	37024	5	You've been good, busier than ever
581	37025	6	We small talk, work and the weather
581	37026	7	Your guard is up and I know why
581	37027	8	
581	37028	9	[Pre-Chorus]
581	37029	10	Because the last time you saw me
581	37030	11	Is still burned in the back of your mind
581	37031	12	You gave me roses and I left them there to die
581	37032	13	[Chorus]
581	37033	14	So, this is me swallowing my pride
581	37034	15	Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night"
581	37035	16	And I go back to December all the time
581	37036	17	It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
581	37037	18	Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
581	37038	19	I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
581	37039	20	I go back to December all the time
581	37040	21	
581	37041	22	[Verse 2]
581	37042	23	These days, I haven't been sleeping
581	37043	24	Staying up, playing back myself leaving
581	37044	25	When your birthday passed and I didn't call
581	37045	26	And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
581	37046	27	I watched you laughing from the passenger side
581	37047	28	And realized I loved you in the fall
581	37048	29	
581	37049	30	[Pre-Chorus]
581	37050	31	And then the cold came, the dark days
581	37051	32	When fear crept into my mind
581	37052	33	You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
581	37053	34	
581	37054	35	[Chorus]
581	37055	36	So, this is me swallowing my pride
581	37056	37	Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night"
581	37057	38	And I go back to December all the time
581	37058	39	It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
581	37059	40	Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
581	37060	41	I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
581	37061	42	I go back to December all the time
581	37062	43	[Bridge]
581	37063	44	I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
581	37064	45	So good to me, so right
581	37065	46	And how you held me in your arms that September night
581	37066	47	The first time you ever saw me cry
581	37067	48	Maybe this is wishful thinking
581	37068	49	Probably mindless dreaming
581	37069	50	But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
581	37070	51	I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
581	37071	52	So, if the chain is on your door, I understand
581	37072	53	
581	37073	54	[Chorus]
581	37074	55	But this is me swallowing my pride
581	37075	56	Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night"
581	37076	57	And I go back to December
581	37077	58	It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
581	37078	59	Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
581	37079	60	I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
581	37080	61	I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
581	37081	62	I go back to December all the time
581	37082	63	
581	37083	64	[Outro]
581	37084	65	All the time
582	38131	1	[Verse 1]
582	38132	2	I am not the kind of girl
582	38133	3	Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
582	38134	4	But you are not the kind of boy
582	38135	5	Who should be marrying the wrong girl
582	38136	6	I sneak in and see your friends
582	38137	7	And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
582	38138	8	And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
582	38139	9	Somewhere back inside a room
582	38140	10	Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry
582	38141	11	[Pre-Chorus]
582	38142	12	This is surely not what you thought it would be
582	38143	13	I lose myself in a daydream
582	38144	14	Where I stand and say
582	38145	15	
582	38146	16	[Chorus]
582	38147	17	Don't say yes, run away now
582	38148	18	I'll meet you when you're out
582	38149	19	Of the church, at the back door
582	38150	20	Don't wait or say a single vow
582	38151	21	You need to hear me out
582	38152	22	And they said, "Speak now"
582	38153	23	
582	38154	24	[Verse 2]
582	38155	25	Fond gestures are exchanged
582	38156	26	And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
582	38157	27	And I am hiding in the curtains
582	38158	28	It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be
582	38159	29	
582	38160	30	[Pre-Chorus]
582	38161	31	She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
582	38162	32	But I know you wish it was me
582	38163	33	You wish it was me, don't you?
582	38164	34	
582	38165	35	[Chorus]
582	38166	36	Don't say yes, run away now
582	38167	37	I'll meet you when you're out
582	38168	38	Of the church, at the back door
582	38169	39	Don't wait or say a single vow
582	38170	40	You need to hear me out
582	38171	41	And they said, "Speak now"
582	38172	42	Don't say yes, run away now (Run away now)
582	38173	43	I'll meet you when you're out
582	38174	44	Of the church, at the back door
582	38175	45	Don't wait or say a single vow (Say a single vow)
582	38176	46	Your time is running out
582	38177	47	And they said, "Speak now"
582	38178	48	[Post-Chorus]
582	38179	49	Ooh (Run away now), la
582	38180	50	Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh
582	38181	51	
582	38182	52	[Bridge]
582	38183	53	I hear the preacher say
582	38184	54	"Speak now or forever hold your peace"
582	38185	55	There's the silence, there's my last chance
582	38186	56	I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
582	38187	57	Horrified looks from everyone in the room
582	38188	58	But I'm only lookin' at you
582	38189	59	
582	38190	60	[Verse 3]
582	38191	61	I am not the kind of girl
582	38192	62	Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
582	38193	63	But you are not the kind of boy
582	38194	64	Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha
582	38195	65	
582	38196	66	[Chorus]
582	38197	67	So, don't say yes, run away now
582	38198	68	I'll meet you when you're out
582	38199	69	Of the church, at the back door
582	38200	70	Don't wait or say a single vow
582	38201	71	You need to hear me out
582	38202	72	They said, "Speak now"
582	38203	73	And you say, "Let's run away now (Run away now)
582	38204	74	I'll meet you when I'm out
582	38205	75	Of my tux, at the back door
582	38206	76	Baby, I didn't say my vows (Say a single vow)
582	38207	77	So glad you were around
582	38208	78	When they said, 'Speak now'"4
583	37221	1	[Verse 1]
583	37222	2	Long were the nights when
583	37223	3	My days once revolved around you
583	37224	4	Counting my footsteps
583	37225	5	Praying the floor won't fall through again
583	37226	6	And my mother accused me of losing my mind
583	37227	7	But I swore I was fine
583	37228	8	You paint me a blue sky
583	37229	9	Then go back and turn it to rain
583	37230	10	And I lived in your chess game
583	37231	11	But you changed the rules everyday
583	37232	12	Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
583	37233	13	Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why
583	37234	14	[Chorus]
583	37235	15	Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
583	37236	16	Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
583	37237	17	The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
583	37238	18	I should've known
583	37239	19	
583	37240	20	[Verse 2]
583	37241	21	Well, maybe it's me
583	37242	22	And my blind optimism to blame
583	37243	23	Or maybe it's you and your sick need
583	37244	24	To give love and take it away
583	37245	25	And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
583	37246	26	Who don't understand
583	37247	27	And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
583	37248	28	"Run as fast as you can"
583	37249	29	
583	37250	30	[Chorus]
583	37251	31	Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
583	37252	32	Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
583	37253	33	The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
583	37254	34	Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
583	37255	35	Don't you think nineteen's too young
583	37256	36	To be played by your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
583	37257	37	I should've known
583	37258	38	
583	37259	39	[Bridge]
583	37260	40	You are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry
583	37261	41	Never impressed by me acing your tests
583	37262	42	All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
583	37263	43	'Cause you burned them out
583	37264	44	But I took your matches before fire could catch me
583	37265	45	So don't look now
583	37266	46	I'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town
583	37267	47	Oh, oh
583	37268	48	[Chorus]
583	37269	49	Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
583	37270	50	Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
583	37271	51	The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
583	37272	52	I see it all now that you're gone
583	37273	53	Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
583	37274	54	The girl in the dress wrote you a song
583	37275	55	You should've known
583	37276	56	
583	37277	57	[Outro]
583	37278	58	You should've known
583	37279	59	Don't you think I was too young?
583	37280	60	You should've known4
584	37752	1	[Verse 1]
584	37753	2	You, with your words like knives
584	37754	3	And swords and weapons that you use against me
584	37755	4	You have knocked me off my feet again
584	37756	5	Got me feeling like I'm nothing
584	37757	6	You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
584	37758	7	Calling me out when I'm wounded
584	37759	8	You, pickin' on the weaker man
584	37760	9	
584	37761	10	[Pre-Chorus]
584	37762	11	Well, you can take me down
584	37763	12	With just one single blow
584	37764	13	But you don't know what you don't know
584	37765	14	[Chorus]
584	37766	15	Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
584	37767	16	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
584	37768	17	Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
584	37769	18	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
584	37770	19	Why you gotta be so mean?
584	37771	20	
584	37772	21	[Verse 2]
584	37773	22	You, with your switching sides
584	37774	23	And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
584	37775	24	You have pointed out my flaws again
584	37776	25	As if I don't already see them
584	37777	26	I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
584	37778	27	'Cause I'll never impress you
584	37779	28	I just wanna feel okay again
584	37780	29	
584	37781	30	[Pre-Chorus]
584	37782	31	I bet you got pushed around
584	37783	32	Somebody made you cold
584	37784	33	But the cycle ends right now
584	37785	34	'Cause you can't lead me down that road
584	37786	35	And you don't know what you don't know
584	37787	36	
584	37788	37	[Chorus]
584	37789	38	Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
584	37790	39	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
584	37791	40	Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
584	37792	41	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
584	37793	42	Why you gotta be so mean?
584	37794	43	[Bridge]
584	37795	44	And I can see you years from now in a bar
584	37796	45	Talking over a football game
584	37797	46	With that same big, loud opinion
584	37798	47	But nobody's listening
584	37799	48	Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
584	37800	49	Drunk and grumblin' on about how I can't sing
584	37801	50	But all you are is mean
584	37802	51	
584	37803	52	[Buildup]
584	37804	53	All you are is mean
584	37805	54	And a liar, and pathetic
584	37806	55	And alone in life, and mean
584	37807	56	And mean, and mean, and mean
584	37808	57	
584	37809	58	[Chorus]
584	37810	59	But someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
584	37811	60	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
584	37812	61	Yeah, someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
584	37813	62	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
584	37814	63	Why you gotta be so mean?
584	37815	64	Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
584	37816	65	(Why you gotta be so mean?)
584	37817	66	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
584	37818	67	(Why you gotta be so mean?)
584	37819	68	Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
584	37820	69	(Why you gotta be so mean?)
584	37821	70	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
584	37822	71	Why you gotta be so mean?
585	38277	1	[Verse 1]
585	38278	2	I used to think one day, we'd tell the story of us
585	38279	3	How we met and the sparks flew instantly
585	38280	4	And people would say, "They're the lucky ones"
585	38281	5	I used to know my place was the spot next to you
585	38282	6	Now, I'm searching the room for an empty seat
585	38283	7	'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on
585	38284	8	
585	38285	9	[Pre-Chorus]
585	38286	10	Oh, a simple complication
585	38287	11	Miscommunications lead to fallout
585	38288	12	So many things that I wish you knew
585	38289	13	So many walls up, I can't break through
585	38290	14	[Chorus]
585	38291	15	Now, I'm standing alone in a crowded room
585	38292	16	And we're not speaking
585	38293	17	And I'm dying to know
585	38294	18	Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah
585	38295	19	I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
585	38296	20	When it all broke down
585	38297	21	And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
585	38298	22	
585	38299	23	[Post-Chorus]
585	38300	24	Next chapter
585	38301	25	
585	38302	26	[Verse 2]
585	38303	27	How'd we end up this way?
585	38304	28	See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
585	38305	29	And you're doing your best to avoid me
585	38306	30	I'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us
585	38307	31	How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
585	38308	32	But you held your pride like you should've held me
585	38309	33	
585	38310	34	[Pre-Chorus]
585	38311	35	Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
585	38312	36	Why are we pretending this is nothing?
585	38313	37	I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
585	38314	38	I've never heard silence quite this loud
585	38315	39	[Chorus]
585	38316	40	Now, I'm standing alone in a crowded room
585	38317	41	And we're not speaking
585	38318	42	And I'm dying to know
585	38319	43	Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah
585	38320	44	I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
585	38321	45	When it all broke down
585	38322	46	And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
585	38323	47	
585	38324	48	[Bridge]
585	38325	49	This is looking like a contest
585	38326	50	Of who can act like they care less
585	38327	51	But I liked it better when you were on my side
585	38328	52	The battle's in your hands now
585	38329	53	But I would lay my armor down
585	38330	54	If you said you'd rather love than fight
585	38331	55	
585	38332	56	[Pre-Chorus]
585	38333	57	So many things that you wish I knew
585	38334	58	But the story of us might be ending soon
585	38335	59	
585	38336	60	[Chorus]
585	38337	61	Now, I'm standing alone in a crowded room
585	38338	62	And we're not speaking
585	38339	63	And I'm dying to know
585	38340	64	Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah
585	38341	65	I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
585	38342	66	When it all broke down
585	38343	67	The story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now
585	38344	68	And we're not speaking
585	38345	69	And I'm dying to know
585	38346	70	Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah
585	38347	71	I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
585	38348	72	'Cause we're goin' down
585	38349	73	And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
585	38350	74	[Outro]
585	38351	75	The end
586	37965	1	[Verse 1]
586	37966	2	Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
586	37967	3	And it's so quiet in the world tonight
586	37968	4	Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
586	37969	5	So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite nightlight
586	37970	6	To you, everything's funny
586	37971	7	You got nothing to regret
586	37972	8	I'd give all I have, honey
586	37973	9	If you could stay like that
586	37974	10	
586	37975	11	[Chorus]
586	37976	12	Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
586	37977	13	Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
586	37978	14	Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
586	37979	15	Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
586	37980	16	I won't let nobody hurt you
586	37981	17	Won't let no one break your heart
586	37982	18	And no one will desert you
586	37983	19	Just try to never grow up
586	37984	20	Never grow up
586	37985	21	[Verse 2]
586	37986	22	You're in the car on the way to the movies
586	37987	23	And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
586	37988	24	At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
586	37989	25	And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
586	37990	26	But don't make her drop you off around the block
586	37991	27	Remember that she's getting older, too
586	37992	28	And don't lose the way that you dance around
586	37993	29	In your PJs getting ready for school
586	37994	30	
586	37995	31	[Chorus]
586	37996	32	Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
586	37997	33	Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
586	37998	34	Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
586	37999	35	Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
586	38000	36	No one's ever burned you
586	38001	37	Nothing's ever left you scarred
586	38002	38	And even though you want to
586	38003	39	Just try to never grow up
586	38004	40	
586	38005	41	[Bridge]
586	38006	42	Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
586	38007	43	Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
586	38008	44	Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
586	38009	45	And all your little brother's favorite songs
586	38010	46	I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
586	38011	47	So here I am in my new apartment
586	38012	48	In a big city, they just dropped me off
586	38013	49	It's so much colder than I thought it would be
586	38014	50	So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
586	38015	51	Wish I'd never grown up
586	38016	52	I wish I'd never grown up
586	38017	53	[Chorus]
586	38018	54	Oh, I don't wanna grow up
586	38019	55	Wish I'd never grown up, I could still be little
586	38020	56	Oh, I don't wanna grow up
586	38021	57	Wish I'd never grown up, it could still be simple
586	38022	58	Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
586	38023	59	Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
586	38024	60	Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
586	38025	61	Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
586	38026	62	Won't let nobody hurt you
586	38027	63	Won't let no one break your heart
586	38028	64	And even though you want to
586	38029	65	Please try to never grow up
586	38030	66	
586	38031	67	[Outro]
586	38032	68	Oh, oh
586	38033	69	Don't you ever grow up
586	38034	70	Oh (Never grow up), just never grow up
587	37281	1	[Verse 1]
587	37282	2	There I was again tonight
587	37283	3	Forcing laughter, faking smiles
587	37284	4	Same old tired, lonely place
587	37285	5	Walls of insincerity
587	37286	6	Shifting eyes and vacancy
587	37287	7	Vanished when I saw your face
587	37288	8	All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
587	37289	9	
587	37290	10	[Verse 2]
587	37291	11	Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
587	37292	12	Across the room, your silhouette
587	37293	13	Starts to make its way to me
587	37294	14	The playful conversation starts
587	37295	15	Counter all your quick remarks
587	37296	16	Like passing notes in secrecy
587	37297	17	And it was enchanting to meet you
587	37298	18	All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
587	37299	19	[Chorus]
587	37300	20	This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
587	37301	21	I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
587	37302	22	I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
587	37303	23	I was enchanted to meet you
587	37304	24	
587	37305	25	[Verse 3]
587	37306	26	The lingering question kept me up
587	37307	27	2AM, who do you love?
587	37308	28	I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
587	37309	29	Now, I'm pacing back and forth
587	37310	30	Wishing you were at my door
587	37311	31	I'd open up and you would say
587	37312	32	"Hey, it was enchanting to meet you"
587	37313	33	All I know is I was enchanted to meet you
587	37314	34	
587	37315	35	[Chorus]
587	37316	36	This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
587	37317	37	I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
587	37318	38	I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
587	37319	39	This night is flawless, don't you let it go
587	37320	40	I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
587	37321	41	I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
587	37322	42	I was enchanted to meet you
587	37323	43	
587	37324	44	[Guitar Solo]
587	37325	45	[Bridge]
587	37326	46	This is me praying that
587	37327	47	This was the very first page
587	37328	48	Not where the storyline ends
587	37329	49	My thoughts will echo your name
587	37330	50	Until I see you again
587	37331	51	These are the words I held back
587	37332	52	As I was leaving too soon
587	37333	53	I was enchanted to meet you
587	37334	54	Please don't be in love with someone else
587	37335	55	Please don't have somebody waiting on you
587	37336	56	Please don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)
587	37337	57	Please don't have somebody waiting on you (Ooh, oh)
587	37338	58	
587	37339	59	[Chorus]
587	37340	60	This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
587	37341	61	I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
587	37342	62	I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
587	37343	63	This night is flawless (Please don't be in love with someone else)
587	37344	64	Don't you let it go
587	37345	65	I'm wonderstruck (Please don't have somebody waiting on you)
587	37346	66	Dancing around all alone
587	37347	67	I'll spend forever (Please don't be in love with someone else)
587	37348	68	Wondering if you knew
587	37349	69	I was enchanted to meet you
587	37350	70	[Outro]
587	37351	71	Please don't be in love with someone else
587	37352	72	Please don't have somebody waiting on you6
588	37150	1	[Intro]
588	37151	2	Now, go stand in the corner and think about what you did
588	37152	3	Ha, time for a little revenge
588	37153	4	
588	37154	5	[Verse 1]
588	37155	6	The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and
588	37156	7	I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
588	37157	8	She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
588	37158	9	She took him faster than you can say "Sabotage"
588	37159	10	I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
588	37160	11	I underestimated just who I was dealing with
588	37161	12	She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
588	37162	13	She underestimated just who she was stealing from
588	37163	14	[Chorus]
588	37164	15	She's not a saint and she's not what you think
588	37165	16	She's an actress, woah
588	37166	17	She's better known for the things that she does
588	37167	18	On the mattress, woah
588	37168	19	Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
588	37169	20	On the playground won't make you many friends
588	37170	21	She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
588	37171	22	There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
588	37172	23	
588	37173	24	[Verse 2]
588	37174	25	She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
588	37175	26	She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
588	37176	27	I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and
588	37177	28	She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
588	37178	29	But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
588	37179	30	Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
588	37180	31	Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
588	37181	32	But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
588	37182	33	(Think about what you did)
588	37183	34	
588	37184	35	[Chorus]
588	37185	36	She's not a saint and she's not what you think
588	37186	37	She's an actress, woah
588	37187	38	She's better known for the things that she does
588	37188	39	On the mattress, woah
588	37189	40	Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
588	37190	41	On the playground won't make you many friends
588	37191	42	She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
588	37192	43	There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
588	37193	44	[Bridge]
588	37194	45	I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
588	37195	46	You might have him, but haven't you heard?
588	37196	47	I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
588	37197	48	You might have him, but I always get the last word
588	37198	49	Woah, woah-ah-oh
588	37199	50	
588	37200	51	[Chorus]
588	37201	52	She's not a saint and she's not what you think
588	37202	53	She's an actress, woah (She deserved it)
588	37203	54	She's better known for the things that she does
588	37204	55	On the mattress, woah
588	37205	56	Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
588	37206	57	On the playground won't make you many friends
588	37207	58	She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
588	37208	59	There is nothing I do better than revenge
588	37209	60	
588	37210	61	[Outro]
588	37211	62	Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
588	37212	63	'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)
588	37213	64	Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)
588	37214	65	I don't think you do, I don't think you do
588	37215	66	Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on)
588	37216	67	Come on, show me how much better you are
588	37217	68	(So much better, yeah?)
588	37218	69	See, you deserve some applause
588	37219	70	'Cause you're so much better
588	37220	71	She took him faster than you could say "Sabotage"2
589	37549	1	[Verse 1]
589	37550	2	I guess you really did it this time
589	37551	3	Left yourself in your war path
589	37552	4	Lost your balance on a tightrope
589	37553	5	Lost your mind trying to get it back
589	37554	6	
589	37555	7	[Pre-Chorus]
589	37556	8	Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
589	37557	9	Always a bigger bed to crawl into
589	37558	10	Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
589	37559	11	And everybody believed in you?
589	37560	12	[Chorus]
589	37561	13	It's alright, just wait and see
589	37562	14	Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
589	37563	15	Who you are is not where you've been
589	37564	16	You're still an innocent
589	37565	17	You're still an innocent
589	37566	18	
589	37567	19	[Verse 2]
589	37568	20	Did some things you can't speak of
589	37569	21	But at night, you live it all again
589	37570	22	You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
589	37571	23	If only you had seen what you know now then
589	37572	24	
589	37573	25	[Pre-Chorus]
589	37574	26	Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
589	37575	27	When everything out of reach
589	37576	28	Someone bigger brought down to you
589	37577	29	Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
589	37578	30	Before the monsters caught up to you?
589	37579	31	
589	37580	32	[Chorus]
589	37581	33	It's alright, just wait and see
589	37582	34	Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
589	37583	35	Who you are is not where you've been
589	37584	36	You're still an innocent
589	37585	37	It's okay, and life is a tough crowd
589	37586	38	Thirty-two and still growing up now
589	37587	39	Who you are is not what you did
589	37588	40	You're still an innocent
589	37589	41	[Bridge]
589	37590	42	Time turns flames to embers
589	37591	43	You'll have new Septembers
589	37592	44	Every one of us has messed up, too, ooh
589	37593	45	Minds change like the weather
589	37594	46	I hope you remember
589	37595	47	Today is never too late to be brand new, oh
589	37596	48	
589	37597	49	[Chorus]
589	37598	50	It's alright, just wait and see
589	37599	51	Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
589	37600	52	Who you are is not where you've been
589	37601	53	You're still an innocent
589	37602	54	It's okay, and life is a tough crowd
589	37603	55	Thirty-two and still growing up now
589	37604	56	Who you are is not what you did
589	37605	57	You're still an innocent
589	37606	58	You're still an innocent
589	37607	59	
589	37608	60	[Outro]
589	37609	61	Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh
589	37610	62	It's never too late to get it back3
590	37353	1	[Verse 1]
590	37354	2	You and I walk a fragile line
590	37355	3	I have known it all this time
590	37356	4	But I never thought I'd live to see it break
590	37357	5	It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
590	37358	6	And I can't trust anything now
590	37359	7	And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake
590	37360	8	
590	37361	9	[Pre-Chorus]
590	37362	10	Woah, holding my breath
590	37363	11	Won't lose you again
590	37364	12	Something's made your eyes go cold
590	37365	13	[Chorus]
590	37366	14	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
590	37367	15	I thought I had you figured out
590	37368	16	Something's gone terribly wrong
590	37369	17	You're all I wanted
590	37370	18	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
590	37371	19	I thought I had you figured out
590	37372	20	Can't breathe whenever you're gone
590	37373	21	Can't turn back now, I'm haunted
590	37374	22	
590	37375	23	[Verse 2]
590	37376	24	Stood there and watched you walk away
590	37377	25	From everything we had
590	37378	26	But I still mean every word I said to you
590	37379	27	He will try to take away my pain
590	37380	28	And he just might make me smile
590	37381	29	But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead
590	37382	30	
590	37383	31	[Pre-Chorus]
590	37384	32	Oh, holding my breath
590	37385	33	Won't see you again
590	37386	34	Something keeps me holding onto nothing
590	37387	35	
590	37388	36	[Chorus]
590	37389	37	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
590	37390	38	I thought I had you figured out
590	37391	39	Something's gone terribly wrong
590	37392	40	You're all I wanted
590	37393	41	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
590	37394	42	I thought I had you figured out
590	37395	43	Can't breathe whenever you're gone
590	37396	44	Can't turn back now, I'm haunted
590	37397	45	[Bridge]
590	37398	46	I know, I know
590	37399	47	I just know
590	37400	48	You're not gone
590	37401	49	You can't be gone, no
590	37402	50	
590	37403	51	[Chorus]
590	37404	52	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
590	37405	53	I thought I had you figured out
590	37406	54	Something's gone terribly wrong
590	37407	55	Won't finish what you started
590	37408	56	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
590	37409	57	I thought I had you figured out
590	37410	58	Can't breathe whenever you're gone
590	37411	59	I can't go back, I'm haunted
590	37412	60	
590	37413	61	[Outro]
590	37414	62	Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
590	37415	63	You and I walk a fragile line
590	37416	64	I have known it all this time
590	37417	65	Never ever thought I'd see it break
590	37418	66	Never thought I'd see it4
591	37611	1	[Verse 1]
591	37612	2	I still remember the look on your face
591	37613	3	Lit through the darkness at 1:58
591	37614	4	The words that you whispered for just us to know
591	37615	5	You told me you loved me
591	37616	6	So why did you go away?
591	37617	7	Away
591	37618	8	
591	37619	9	[Verse 2]
591	37620	10	I do recall now, the smell of the rain
591	37621	11	Fresh on the pavement
591	37622	12	I ran off the plane
591	37623	13	That July ninth, the beat of your heart
591	37624	14	It jumps through your shirt
591	37625	15	I can still feel your arms
591	37626	16	[Pre-Chorus]
591	37627	17	But now I'll go
591	37628	18	Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
591	37629	19	All that I know is I don't know
591	37630	20	How to be something you miss
591	37631	21	
591	37632	22	[Chorus]
591	37633	23	I never thought we'd have a last kiss
591	37634	24	Never imagined we'd end like this
591	37635	25	Your name, forever the name on my lips
591	37636	26	
591	37637	27	[Verse 3]
591	37638	28	I do remember the swing of your step
591	37639	29	The life of the party, you're showing off again
591	37640	30	And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
591	37641	31	I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did
591	37642	32	Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
591	37643	33	I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
591	37644	34	How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
591	37645	35	There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions
591	37646	36	
591	37647	37	[Pre-Chorus]
591	37648	38	And I'll go
591	37649	39	Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
591	37650	40	All that I know is I don't know
591	37651	41	How to be something you miss
591	37652	42	[Chorus]
591	37653	43	I never thought we'd have a last kiss
591	37654	44	I never imagined we'd end like this
591	37655	45	Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh
591	37656	46	
591	37657	47	[Bridge]
591	37658	48	So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
591	37659	49	And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
591	37660	50	And I'll keep up with our old friends
591	37661	51	Just to ask them how you are
591	37662	52	Hope it's nice where you are
591	37663	53	And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
591	37664	54	And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
591	37665	55	You can plan for a change in the weather and time
591	37666	56	But I never planned on you changing your mind
591	37667	57	
591	37668	58	[Pre-Chorus]
591	37669	59	So, I'll go
591	37670	60	Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
591	37671	61	All that I know is I don't know
591	37672	62	How to be something you miss
591	37673	63	
591	37674	64	[Chorus]
591	37675	65	I never thought we'd have a last kiss
591	37676	66	Never imagined we'd end like this
591	37677	67	Your name, forever the name on my lips
591	37678	68	[Outro]
591	37679	69	Just like our last kiss
591	37680	70	Forever the name on my lips
591	37681	71	Forever the name on my lips
591	37682	72	Just like our last4
592	37683	1	[Verse 1]
592	37684	2	I said, "Remember this moment"
592	37685	3	In the back of my mind
592	37686	4	The time we stood with our shaking hands
592	37687	5	The crowds in stands went wild
592	37688	6	We were the kings and the queens
592	37689	7	And they read off our names
592	37690	8	The night you danced like you knew our lives would
592	37691	9	Never be the same
592	37692	10	You held your head like a hero on a history book page
592	37693	11	It was the end of a decade
592	37694	12	But the start of an age
592	37695	13	[Chorus]
592	37696	14	Long live the walls we crashed through
592	37697	15	How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
592	37698	16	I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
592	37699	17	And bring on all the pretenders
592	37700	18	One day, we will be remembered
592	37701	19	
592	37702	20	[Verse 2]
592	37703	21	I said, "Remember this feeling"
592	37704	22	I pass the pictures around
592	37705	23	Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
592	37706	24	Wishing for right now
592	37707	25	We are the kings and the queens
592	37708	26	You traded your baseball cap for a crown
592	37709	27	When they gave us our trophies
592	37710	28	And we held them up for our town
592	37711	29	And the cynics were outraged
592	37712	30	Screaming, "This is absurd"
592	37713	31	'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves in ripped up jeans
592	37714	32	Got to rule the world
592	37715	33	
592	37716	34	[Chorus]
592	37717	35	Long live the walls we crashed through
592	37718	36	How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
592	37719	37	I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
592	37720	38	And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
592	37721	39	Long live all the mountains we moved
592	37722	40	I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
592	37723	41	I was screaming, "Long live that look on your face"
592	37724	42	And bring on all the pretenders
592	37725	43	One day, we will be remembered
592	37726	44	[Bridge]
592	37727	45	Hold on to spinning around
592	37728	46	Confetti falls to the ground
592	37729	47	May these memories break our fall
592	37730	48	Will you take a moment? Promise me this
592	37731	49	That you'll stand by me forever
592	37732	50	But if, God forbid, fate should step in
592	37733	51	And force us into a goodbye
592	37734	52	If you have children some day
592	37735	53	When they point to the pictures
592	37736	54	Please tell 'em my name
592	37737	55	Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
592	37738	56	Tell 'em how I hope they shine
592	37739	57	Long live the walls we crashed through
592	37740	58	I had the time of my life with you
592	37741	59	
592	37742	60	[Chorus]
592	37743	61	Long, long live the walls we crashed through
592	37744	62	How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
592	37745	63	And I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
592	37746	64	And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
592	37747	65	Singing, "Long live all the mountains we moved"
592	37748	66	I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
592	37749	67	And long, long live that look on your face
592	37750	68	And bring on all the pretenders
592	37751	69	One day, we will be remembered3
593	38035	1	[Verse 1]
593	38036	2	Elevator buttons and morning air
593	38037	3	Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
593	38038	4	If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
593	38039	5	But right now, my time is theirs
593	38040	6	Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
593	38041	7	They'll judge it like they know about me and you
593	38042	8	And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
593	38043	9	The jury's out, but my choice is you
593	38044	10	
593	38045	11	[Chorus]
593	38046	12	So don't you worry your pretty little mind
593	38047	13	People throw rocks at things that shine
593	38048	14	And life makes love look hard
593	38049	15	The stakes are high, the water's rough
593	38050	16	But this love is ours
593	38051	17	[Verse 2]
593	38052	18	You never know what people have up their sleeves
593	38053	19	Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
593	38054	20	Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
593	38055	21	But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
593	38056	22	And you'll say
593	38057	23	
593	38058	24	[Chorus]
593	38059	25	Don't you worry your pretty little mind
593	38060	26	People throw rocks at things that shine
593	38061	27	And life makes love look hard
593	38062	28	The stakes are high, the water's rough
593	38063	29	But this love is ours
593	38064	30	
593	38065	31	[Bridge]
593	38066	32	And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
593	38067	33	Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
593	38068	34	I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
593	38069	35	'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
593	38070	36	And I love the riddles that you speak
593	38071	37	And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
593	38072	38	Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours
593	38073	39	
593	38074	40	[Chorus]
593	38075	41	So don't you worry your pretty little mind
593	38076	42	People throw rocks at things that shine
593	38077	43	And life makes love look hard
593	38078	44	Don't you worry your pretty little mind
593	38079	45	People throw rocks at things that shine
593	38080	46	But they can't take what's ours
593	38081	47	They can't take what's ours
593	38082	48	The stakes are high, the water's rough
593	38083	49	But this love is ours
594	37485	1	[Verse 1]
594	37486	2	Last night, I heard my own heart beating
594	37487	3	Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
594	37488	4	Six months gone and I'm still reaching
594	37489	5	Even though I know you're not there
594	37490	6	I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
594	37491	7	Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
594	37492	8	Maybe I've been going back too much lately
594	37493	9	When time stood still and I had you
594	37494	10	
594	37495	11	[Chorus]
594	37496	12	Come back, come back, come back to me like
594	37497	13	You would, you would if this was a movie
594	37498	14	Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
594	37499	15	Come back, come back, come back to me like
594	37500	16	You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
594	37501	17	I know that we could work it out somehow
594	37502	18	But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now
594	37503	19	[Verse 2]
594	37504	20	I know people change and these things happen
594	37505	21	But I remember how it was back then
594	37506	22	Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughin'
594	37507	23	'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
594	37508	24	Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
594	37509	25	Flashback to the night when you said to me
594	37510	26	That nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
594	37511	27	Back before I knew how much I had to lose
594	37512	28	
594	37513	29	[Chorus]
594	37514	30	Come back, come back, come back to me like
594	37515	31	You would, you would if this was a movie
594	37516	32	Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
594	37517	33	Come back, come back, come back to me like
594	37518	34	You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
594	37519	35	I know that we could work it out somehow
594	37520	36	But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now
594	37521	37	
594	37522	38	[Bridge]
594	37523	39	If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
594	37524	40	I've been waiting for you ever since you've been gone
594	37525	41	I just want it back the way it was before
594	37526	42	And I just wanna see you back at my front door
594	37527	43	
594	37528	44	[Chorus]
594	37529	45	And I say, "Come back, come back, come back to me like
594	37530	46	You would before you said it's not that easy
594	37531	47	Before the fight, before I locked you out
594	37532	48	But I take it all back now"
594	37533	49	[Chorus]
594	37534	50	Come back, come back, come back to me like
594	37535	51	You would, you would if this was a movie
594	37536	52	Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
594	37537	53	Come back, come back, come back to me like
594	37538	54	You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
594	37539	55	I know that we could work it out somehow
594	37540	56	But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now
594	37541	57	
594	37542	58	[Outro]
594	37543	59	You'd be here by now
594	37544	60	It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
594	37545	61	Baby, what about the ending?
594	37546	62	Oh, I thought you'd be here by now
594	37547	63	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
594	37548	64	Thought you'd be here by now2
595	38209	1	[Verse 1]
595	38210	2	Tall, dark, and superman
595	38211	3	He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
595	38212	4	To save the world or go to work
595	38213	5	It's the same thing to me
595	38214	6	He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
595	38215	7	I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
595	38216	8	I hang on every word you say, yay
595	38217	9	And you smile and say, "How are you?”
595	38218	10	I say, "Just fine"
595	38219	11	I always forget to tell you, I love you
595	38220	12	I love you forever
595	38221	13	[Chorus]
595	38222	14	I watch superman fly away
595	38223	15	You've got a busy day today
595	38224	16	Go save the world, I'll be around
595	38225	17	I watch superman fly away
595	38226	18	Come back, I'll be with you someday
595	38227	19	I'll be right here on the ground
595	38228	20	When you come back down
595	38229	21	
595	38230	22	[Verse 2]
595	38231	23	Tall, dark and beautiful
595	38232	24	He's complicated, he's irrational
595	38233	25	But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
595	38234	26	Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
595	38235	27	He's not all bad like his reputation
595	38236	28	And I can't hear one single word they say
595	38237	29	And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be okay
595	38238	30	I always forget to tell you I love you
595	38239	31	I loved you from the very first day
595	38240	32	
595	38241	33	[Chorus]
595	38242	34	I watch superman fly away
595	38243	35	You've got a busy day today
595	38244	36	Go save the world, I'll be around
595	38245	37	I watch superman fly away
595	38246	38	Come back, I'll be with you someday
595	38247	39	I'll be right here on the ground
595	38248	40	When you come back down
595	38249	41	[Bridge]
595	38250	42	And I watch you fly around the world
595	38251	43	And I hope you don't save some other girl
595	38252	44	Don't forget, don't forget about me
595	38253	45	I'm far away, but I never let you go
595	38254	46	I'm love-struck and looking out the window
595	38255	47	Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
595	38256	48	
595	38257	49	[Breakdown]
595	38258	50	Right here, wishing the flowers were from you
595	38259	51	Wishing the card was from you
595	38260	52	Wishing the call was from you
595	38261	53	'Cause I loved you from the very first day
595	38262	54	
595	38263	55	[Chorus - Variation]
595	38264	56	I watch superman fly away
595	38265	57	You've got a busy day today
595	38266	58	Go save the world, I'll be around
595	38267	59	Forever and ever here
595	38268	60	I watch superman fly away
595	38269	61	I swear, I'll be with you someday
595	38270	62	I'll be right here on the ground
595	38271	63	When you come back down
595	38272	64	
595	38273	65	[Outro]
595	38274	66	La, la, la, la, la, la
595	38275	67	La, la, la, la, la, la
595	38276	68	When you come back down1
596	37085	1	[Verse 1]
596	37086	2	I'm so glad you made time to see me
596	37087	3	How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
596	37088	4	I haven't seen them in a while
596	37089	5	You've been good, busier than ever
596	37090	6	We small talk, work and the weather
596	37091	7	Your guard is up and I know why
596	37092	8	
596	37093	9	[Pre-Chorus]
596	37094	10	Because the last time
596	37095	11	You saw me is still burned in the back of your mind
596	37096	12	You gave me roses and I left them there to die
596	37097	13	[Chorus]
596	37098	14	So this is me swallowing my pride
596	37099	15	Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
596	37100	16	And I go back to December all the time
596	37101	17	It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
596	37102	18	Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
596	37103	19	I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
596	37104	20	I go back to December all the time
596	37105	21	
596	37106	22	[Verse 2]
596	37107	23	These days, I haven't been sleeping
596	37108	24	Staying up playing back myself leaving
596	37109	25	When your birthday passed and I didn't call
596	37110	26	Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
596	37111	27	I watched you laughing from the passenger side
596	37112	28	And realized I loved you in the fall
596	37113	29	
596	37114	30	[Pre-Chorus]
596	37115	31	And then the cold came
596	37116	32	The dark days when fear crept into my mind
596	37117	33	You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
596	37118	34	
596	37119	35	[Chorus]
596	37120	36	So this is me swallowing my pride
596	37121	37	Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
596	37122	38	And I go back to December all the time
596	37123	39	It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
596	37124	40	Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
596	37125	41	I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
596	37126	42	I go back to December all the time
596	37127	43	[Bridge]
596	37128	44	I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
596	37129	45	So good to me, so right
596	37130	46	And how you held me in your arms that September night
596	37131	47	The first time you ever saw me cry
596	37132	48	Maybe this is wishful thinking
596	37133	49	Probably mindless dreaming
596	37134	50	But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
596	37135	51	I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
596	37136	52	So if the chain is on your door, I understand
596	37137	53	
596	37138	54	[Chorus]
596	37139	55	But this is me swallowing my pride
596	37140	56	Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
596	37141	57	And I go back to December
596	37142	58	It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
596	37143	59	Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
596	37144	60	I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
596	37145	61	I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
596	37146	62	I go back to December all the time
596	37147	63	
596	37148	64	[Outro]
596	37149	65	All the time
597	37419	1	[Verse 1]
597	37420	2	You and I walk a fragile line
597	37421	3	I have known it all this time
597	37422	4	But I never thought I'd live to see it break
597	37423	5	It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
597	37424	6	And I can't trust anything now
597	37425	7	And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake
597	37426	8	
597	37427	9	[Pre-Chorus]
597	37428	10	Woah, holding my breath
597	37429	11	Won't lose you again
597	37430	12	Something's made your eyes go cold
597	37431	13	[Chorus]
597	37432	14	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
597	37433	15	I thought I had you figured out
597	37434	16	Something's gone terribly wrong
597	37435	17	You're all I wanted
597	37436	18	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
597	37437	19	I thought I had you figured out
597	37438	20	Can't breathe whenevеr you're gone
597	37439	21	Can't turn back now, I'm haunted
597	37440	22	
597	37441	23	[Verse 2]
597	37442	24	Stood thеre and watched you walk away (Walk away)
597	37443	25	From everything we had
597	37444	26	But I still mean every word I said to you
597	37445	27	He will try to take away my pain
597	37446	28	And he just might make me smile
597	37447	29	But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead
597	37448	30	
597	37449	31	[Pre-Chorus]
597	37450	32	Oh-woah, holding my breath
597	37451	33	Won't see you again
597	37452	34	Something keeps me holding onto nothing
597	37453	35	
597	37454	36	[Chorus]
597	37455	37	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
597	37456	38	I thought I had you figured out
597	37457	39	Something's gone terribly wrong
597	37458	40	You're all I wanted
597	37459	41	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
597	37460	42	I thought I had you figured out
597	37461	43	Can't breathe whenever you're gone
597	37462	44	Can't turn back now, I'm haunted
597	37463	45	[Bridge]
597	37464	46	I know, I know
597	37465	47	I just know
597	37466	48	You're not gone
597	37467	49	You can't be gone, no
597	37468	50	
597	37469	51	[Chorus]
597	37470	52	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
597	37471	53	I thought I had you figured out
597	37472	54	Something's gone terribly wrong
597	37473	55	Won't finish what you started
597	37474	56	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
597	37475	57	I thought I had you figured out
597	37476	58	Can't breathe whenever you're gone
597	37477	59	I can't go back, I'm haunted

597	37480	62	Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
597	37481	63	You and I walk a fragile line
597	37482	64	I have known it all this time
597	37483	65	Never ever thought I'd see it break
597	37484	66	Never thought I'd see it
598	37894	1	[Intro]
598	37895	2	Oh-oh, oh-oh
598	37896	3	Oh-oh, oh-oh
598	37897	4	
598	37898	5	[Verse 1]
598	37899	6	You were in college working part time waitin' tables
598	37900	7	Left a small town, never looked back
598	37901	8	I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
598	37902	9	Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts
598	37903	10	
598	37904	11	[Pre-Chorus]
598	37905	12	I say, "Can you believe it?"
598	37906	13	As we're lyin' on the couch
598	37907	14	The moment I could see it
598	37908	15	Yes, yes, I can see it now
598	37909	16	[Chorus]
598	37910	17	Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
598	37911	18	You put your arm around me for the first time
598	37912	19	You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
598	37913	20	You are the best thing that's ever been mine
598	37914	21	
598	37915	22	[Verse 2]
598	37916	23	Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
598	37917	24	And there's a drawer of my things at your place
598	37918	25	You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
598	37919	26	You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
598	37920	27	
598	37921	28	[Pre-Chorus]
598	37922	29	But we got bills to pay
598	37923	30	We got nothing figured out
598	37924	31	When it was hard to take
598	37925	32	Yes, yes, this is what I thought about
598	37926	33	
598	37927	34	[Chorus]
598	37928	35	Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
598	37929	36	You put your arm around me for the first time
598	37930	37	You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
598	37931	38	You are the best thing that's ever been mine
598	37932	39	Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
598	37933	40	You saw me start to believe for the first time
598	37934	41	You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
598	37935	42	You are the best thing that's ever been mine
598	37936	43	[Post-Chorus]
598	37937	44	Oh-oh, oh-oh
598	37938	45	
598	37939	46	[Bridge]
598	37940	47	And I remember that fight, 2:30AM
598	37941	48	As everything was slipping right out of our hands
598	37942	49	I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
598	37943	50	Braced myself for the goodbye
598	37944	51	'Cause that's all I've ever known
598	37945	52	Then you took me by surprise
598	37946	53	You said, "I'll never leave you alone"
598	37947	54	
598	37948	55	[Chorus]
598	37949	56	You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water
598	37950	57	And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
598	37951	58	I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
598	37952	59	She is the best thing that's ever been mine"
598	37953	60	
598	37954	61	[Post-Chorus]
598	37955	62	Hold on, make it last
598	37956	63	Hold on, never turn back
598	37957	64	(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (Make it last)
598	37958	65	(Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine (Hold on)
598	37959	66	
598	37960	67	[Outro]
598	37961	68	Yes, yes, do you believe it? (Hold on)
598	37962	69	Yes, yes, we're gonna make it now (Hold on)
598	37963	70	Yes, yes, I can see it
598	37964	71	Yes, yes, I can see it now
599	39207	1	[Intro]
599	39208	2	Ah-ah, ah-ah

599	39218	12	I say, "Can you believe it?"
599	39219	13	As we're lyin' on the couch
599	39220	14	The moment I could see it
599	39221	15	Yes, yes, I can see it now
599	39222	16	
599	39223	17	[Chorus]
599	39224	18	Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
599	39225	19	You put your arm around me for the first time
599	39226	20	You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
599	39227	21	You are the best thing that's ever been mine
599	39228	22	
599	39229	23	[Verse 2]
599	39230	24	Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
599	39231	25	And there's a drawer of my things at your place
599	39232	26	You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
599	39233	27	You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
599	39234	28	[Pre-Chorus]
599	39235	29	But we got bills to pay
599	39236	30	We got nothing figured out
599	39237	31	When it was hard to take
599	39238	32	Yes, yes, this is what I thought about
599	39239	33	
599	39240	34	[Chorus]
599	39241	35	Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
599	39242	36	You put your arm around me for the first time
599	39243	37	You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
599	39244	38	You are the best thing that's ever been mine
599	39245	39	Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
599	39246	40	You saw me start to believe for the first time
599	39247	41	You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
599	39248	42	You are the best thing that's ever been mine
599	39249	43	
599	39250	44	[Post-Chorus]
599	39251	45	Oh-oh, oh
599	39252	46	
599	39253	47	[Bridge]
599	39254	48	And I remember that fight, 2:30AM
599	39255	49	As everything was slippin' right out of our hands
599	39256	50	I ran out cryin' and you followed me out into the street
599	39257	51	Braced myself for the goodbye
599	39258	52	'Cause that's all I've ever known
599	39259	53	Then you took me by surprise
599	39260	54	You said, "I'll never leave you alone"
599	39261	55	[Chorus]
599	39262	56	You said, "I remember how it felt sitting by the water
599	39263	57	And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
599	39264	58	I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
599	39265	59	She is the best thing that's ever been mine"
599	39266	60	
599	39267	61	[Post-Chorus]
599	39268	62	Hold on and make it last
599	39269	63	Hold on, never turn back
599	39270	64	(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
599	39271	65	(Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine
599	39272	66	
599	39273	67	[Outro]
599	39274	68	Yes, yes, do you believe it? (Hold on)
599	39275	69	Yes, yes, we're gonna make it now (Hold on, yeah)
599	39276	70	Yes, yes, and I can see it (Hold on)
599	39277	71	Yes, yes, I can see it now
600	39406	1	[Verse 1]
600	39407	2	The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
600	39408	3	And I'm a house of cards
600	39409	4	You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'
600	39410	5	But I kinda know that I won't get far
600	39411	6	And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch
600	39412	7	Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of
600	39413	8	
600	39414	9	[Chorus]
600	39415	10	Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
600	39416	11	Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
600	39417	12	'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
600	39418	13	Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
600	39419	14	Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
600	39420	15	'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
600	39421	16	
600	39422	17	[Verse 2]
600	39423	18	My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea
600	39424	19	You touch me once and it's really somethin'
600	39425	20	You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
600	39426	21	I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
600	39427	22	But with you, I know it's no good
600	39428	23	And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would
600	39429	24	
600	39430	25	[Chorus]
600	39431	26	Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
600	39432	27	Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
600	39433	28	'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
600	39434	29	Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
600	39435	30	Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
600	39436	31	'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
600	39437	32	[Bridge]
600	39438	33	I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
600	39439	34	Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me
600	39440	35	It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
600	39441	36	And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?
600	39442	37	I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show
600	39443	38	
600	39444	39	[Chorus]
600	39445	40	Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
600	39446	41	Kiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain
600	39447	42	'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
600	39448	43	Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
600	39449	44	Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
600	39450	45	'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
600	39451	46	
600	39452	47	[Outro]
600	39453	48	And the sparks fly
600	39454	49	Oh, baby, smile
600	39455	50	And the sparks fly
601	38352	1	[Verse 1]
601	38353	2	I'm so glad you made time to see me
601	38354	3	How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
601	38355	4	I haven't seen them in a while
601	38356	5	You've been good, busier than ever
601	38357	6	We small talk, work and the weather
601	38358	7	Your guard is up and I know why
601	38359	8	
601	38360	9	[Pre-Chorus]
601	38361	10	Because the last time you saw me
601	38362	11	Is still burned in the back of your mind
601	38363	12	You gave me roses and I left them there to die
601	38364	13	
601	38365	14	[Chorus]
601	38366	15	So, this is me swallowing my pride
601	38367	16	Standin' in front of you sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
601	38368	17	And I go back to December all the time
601	38369	18	It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
601	38370	19	Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
601	38371	20	I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
601	38372	21	I go back to December all the time
601	38373	22	
601	38374	23	[Verse 2]
601	38375	24	These days, I haven't been sleeping
601	38376	25	Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
601	38377	26	When your birthday passed and I didn't call
601	38378	27	Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
601	38379	28	I watched you laughin' from the passenger side
601	38380	29	And realized I loved you in the fall
601	38381	30	[Pre-Chorus]
601	38382	31	And then the cold came, the dark days
601	38383	32	When fear crept into my mind
601	38384	33	You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
601	38385	34	
601	38386	35	[Chorus]
601	38387	36	So, this is me swallowing my pride
601	38388	37	Standin' in front of you, sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
601	38389	38	And I go back to December all the time
601	38390	39	It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
601	38391	40	Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
601	38392	41	I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
601	38393	42	I go back to December all the time
601	38394	43	
601	38395	44	[Bridge]
601	38396	45	I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
601	38397	46	So good to me, so right
601	38398	47	And how you held me in your arms that September night
601	38399	48	The first time you ever saw me cry
601	38400	49	Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
601	38401	50	Probably mindless dreaming
601	38402	51	But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
601	38403	52	I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
601	38404	53	So, if the chain is on your door, I understand
601	38405	54	
601	38406	55	[Chorus]
601	38407	56	But this is me swallowing my pride
601	38408	57	Standin' in front of you, sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
601	38409	58	And I go back to December
601	38410	59	It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
601	38411	60	Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
601	38412	61	I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
601	38413	62	I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
601	38414	63	I go back to December all the time
601	38415	64	[Outro]
601	38416	65	All the time
602	39456	1	[Verse 1]
602	39457	2	I am not the kind of girl
602	39458	3	Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
602	39459	4	But you are not the kind of boy
602	39460	5	Who should be marrying the wrong girl
602	39461	6	I sneak in and see your friends
602	39462	7	And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
602	39463	8	And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
602	39464	9	Somewhere back inside a room
602	39465	10	Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry
602	39466	11	
602	39467	12	[Pre-Chorus]
602	39468	13	This is surely not what you thought it would be
602	39469	14	I lose myself in a daydream
602	39470	15	Where I stand and say
602	39471	16	
602	39472	17	[Chorus]
602	39473	18	Don't say yes, run away now
602	39474	19	I'll meet you when you're out
602	39475	20	Of the church, at the back door
602	39476	21	Don't wait or say a single vow
602	39477	22	You need to hear me out
602	39478	23	And they said, "Spеak now"
602	39479	24	
602	39480	25	[Verse 2]
602	39481	26	Fond gestures are еxchanged
602	39482	27	And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
602	39483	28	And I am hiding in the curtains
602	39484	29	It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be
602	39485	30	[Pre-Chorus]
602	39486	31	She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
602	39487	32	But I know you wish it was me
602	39488	33	You wish it was me, don't you?
602	39489	34	
602	39490	35	[Chorus]
602	39491	36	Don't say yes, run away now
602	39492	37	I'll meet you when you're out
602	39493	38	Of the church, at the back door
602	39494	39	Don't wait or say a single vow
602	39495	40	You need to hear me out
602	39496	41	And they said, "Speak now"
602	39497	42	Don't say yes, run away now (Run away now)
602	39498	43	I'll meet you when you're out
602	39499	44	Of the church, at the back door
602	39500	45	Don't wait or say a single vow (Say a single vow)
602	39501	46	Your time is running out
602	39502	47	And they said, "Speak now"
602	39503	48	
602	39504	49	[Post-Chorus]
602	39505	50	Ooh (Run away now), la
602	39506	51	Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh
602	39507	52	
602	39508	53	[Bridge]
602	39509	54	I hear the preacher say
602	39510	55	"Speak now or forever hold your peace"
602	39511	56	There's the silence, there's my last chance
602	39512	57	I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
602	39513	58	Horrified looks from everyone in the room
602	39514	59	But I'm only lookin' at you
602	39515	60	[Verse 3]
602	39516	61	I am not the kind of girl
602	39517	62	Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
602	39518	63	But you are not the kind of boy
602	39519	64	Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha
602	39520	65	
602	39521	66	[Chorus]
602	39522	67	So, don't say yes, run away now
602	39523	68	I'll meet you when you're out
602	39524	69	Of the church, at the back door
602	39525	70	Don't wait or say a single vow
602	39526	71	You need to hear me out
602	39527	72	They said, "Speak now"
602	39528	73	And you say, "Let's run away now (Run away now)
602	39529	74	I'll meet you when I'm out
602	39530	75	Of my tux, at the back door
602	39531	76	Baby, I didn't say my vows (Say a single vow)
602	39532	77	So glad you were around
602	39533	78	When they said, 'Speak now'"
603	38543	1	[Verse 1]
603	38544	2	Long were the nights
603	38545	3	When my days once revolved around you
603	38546	4	Counting my footsteps
603	38547	5	Prayin' the floor won't fall through again
603	38548	6	And my mother accused me of losin' my mind
603	38549	7	But I swore I was fine
603	38550	8	You paint me a blue sky
603	38551	9	Then go back to turn it to rain
603	38552	10	And I lived in your chess game
603	38553	11	But you change the rules every day
603	38554	12	Wonderin' which version of you
603	38555	13	I might get on the phone tonight
603	38556	14	Well, I stopped pickin' up
603	38557	15	And this song is to let you know why
603	38558	16	
603	38559	17	[Chorus]
603	38560	18	Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
603	38561	19	Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
603	38562	20	The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
603	38563	21	I shoulda known
603	38564	22	
603	38565	23	[Verse 2]
603	38566	24	Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
603	38567	25	Or maybe it's you and your sick need
603	38568	26	To give love and take it away
603	38569	27	And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
603	38570	28	Who don't understand
603	38571	29	And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said
603	38572	30	"Run as fast as you can"
603	38573	31	[Chorus]
603	38574	32	Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
603	38575	33	Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
603	38576	34	The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
603	38577	35	Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
603	38578	36	Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played by
603	38579	37	Your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
603	38580	38	I shoulda known
603	38581	39	
603	38582	40	[Instrumental Break]
603	38583	41	
603	38584	42	[Bridge]
603	38585	43	You are an expert at "Sorry" and keepin' lines blurry
603	38586	44	Never impressed by me acing your tests
603	38587	45	All the girls that you run dry have tired, lifeless eyes
603	38588	46	'Cause you burned them out
603	38589	47	But I took your matches before fire could catch me
603	38590	48	So don't look now
603	38591	49	I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town
603	38592	50	Oh
603	38593	51	
603	38594	52	[Chorus]
603	38595	53	Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
603	38596	54	Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
603	38597	55	The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
603	38598	56	I see it all now that you're gone
603	38599	57	Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
603	38600	58	The girl in the dress wrote you a song
603	38601	59	You shoulda known
603	38602	60	[Outro]
603	38603	61	You shoulda known
603	38604	62	Don't you think I was too young?
603	38605	63	You shoulda known
604	39137	1	[Verse 1]
604	39138	2	You, with your words like knives
604	39139	3	And swords and weapons that you use against me
604	39140	4	You have knocked me off my feet again
604	39141	5	Got me feelin' like a nothing
604	39142	6	You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
604	39143	7	Calling me out when I'm wounded
604	39144	8	You, pickin' on the weaker man
604	39145	9	
604	39146	10	[Pre-Chorus]
604	39147	11	Well, you can take me down
604	39148	12	With just one single blow
604	39149	13	But you don't know what you don't know
604	39150	14	
604	39151	15	[Chorus]
604	39152	16	Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
604	39153	17	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
604	39154	18	Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
604	39155	19	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
604	39156	20	Why you gotta be so mean?
604	39157	21	
604	39158	22	[Verse 2]
604	39159	23	You, with your switching sides
604	39160	24	And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
604	39161	25	You have pointed out my flaws again
604	39162	26	As if I don't already see them
604	39163	27	I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
604	39164	28	'Cause I'll never impress you
604	39165	29	I just wanna feel okay again
604	39166	30	[Pre-Chorus]
604	39167	31	I bet you got pushed around
604	39168	32	Somebody made you cold
604	39169	33	But the cycle ends right now
604	39170	34	'Cause you can't lead me down that road
604	39171	35	And you don't know what you don't know
604	39172	36	
604	39173	37	[Chorus]
604	39174	38	Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
604	39175	39	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
604	39176	40	Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
604	39177	41	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
604	39178	42	Why you gotta be so mean?
604	39179	43	
604	39180	44	[Bridge]
604	39181	45	And I can see you years from now in a bar
604	39182	46	Talking over a football game
604	39183	47	With that same big, loud opinion but nobody's listening
604	39184	48	Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
604	39185	49	Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
604	39186	50	But all you are is mean
604	39187	51	
604	39188	52	[Buildup]
604	39189	53	All you are is mean
604	39190	54	And a liar, and pathetic
604	39191	55	And alone in life, and mean
604	39192	56	And mean, and mean, and mean
604	39193	57	[Chorus]
604	39194	58	But someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
604	39195	59	And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
604	39196	60	Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
604	39197	61	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
604	39198	62	Why you gotta be so mean?
604	39199	63	Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
604	39200	64	(Why you gotta be so mean?)
604	39201	65	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
604	39202	66	(Why you gotta be so mean?)
604	39203	67	Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
604	39204	68	(Why you gotta be so mean?)
604	39205	69	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
604	39206	70	Why you gotta be so mean?
605	39602	1	[Verse 1]
605	39603	2	I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
605	39604	3	How we met and the sparks flew instantly
605	39605	4	And people would say, "They’re the lucky ones"
605	39606	5	I used to know my place was the spot next to you
605	39607	6	Now I'm searchin' the room for an empty seat
605	39608	7	’Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
605	39609	8	
605	39610	9	[Pre-Chorus]
605	39611	10	Oh, a simple complication
605	39612	11	Miscommunications lead to fallout
605	39613	12	So many things that I wish you knew
605	39614	13	So many walls up, I can't break through
605	39615	14	
605	39616	15	[Chorus]
605	39617	16	Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
605	39618	17	And we're not speakin'
605	39619	18	And I’m dyin’ to know, is it killin' you
605	39620	19	Like it’s killin' me? Yeah
605	39621	20	I don't know what to say since thе twist of fate
605	39622	21	When it all broke down
605	39623	22	And thе story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
605	39624	23	
605	39625	24	[Post-Chorus]
605	39626	25	Next chapter
605	39627	26	[Verse 2]
605	39628	27	How'd we end up this way?
605	39629	28	See me nervously pulling at my clothes and tryin’ to look busy
605	39630	29	And you're doin' your best to avoid me
605	39631	30	I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
605	39632	31	How I was losin' my mind when I saw you here
605	39633	32	But you held your pride like you should've held me
605	39634	33	
605	39635	34	[Pre-Chorus]
605	39636	35	Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
605	39637	36	Why are we pretending this is nothin'?
605	39638	37	I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
605	39639	38	I've never heard silence quite this loud
605	39640	39	
605	39641	40	[Chorus]
605	39642	41	Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
605	39643	42	And we're not speakin'
605	39644	43	And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
605	39645	44	Like it's killin' me? Yeah
605	39646	45	I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
605	39647	46	When it all broke down
605	39648	47	And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
605	39649	48	
605	39650	49	[Bridge]
605	39651	50	This is looking like a contest
605	39652	51	Of who can act like they care less
605	39653	52	But I liked it better when you were on my side
605	39654	53	The battle's in your hands now
605	39655	54	But I would lay my armor down
605	39656	55	If you said you'd rather love than fight
605	39657	56	[Pre-Chorus]
605	39658	57	So many things that you wish I knew
605	39659	58	But the story of us might be ending soon
605	39660	59	
605	39661	60	[Chorus]
605	39662	61	Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
605	39663	62	And we're not speakin'
605	39664	63	And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
605	39665	64	Like it's killin' me? Yeah
605	39666	65	And I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
605	39667	66	When it all broke down
605	39668	67	And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now
605	39669	68	And we're not speakin'
605	39670	69	And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
605	39671	70	Like it's killin' me? Yeah
605	39672	71	I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
605	39673	72	'Cause we're goin' down
605	39674	73	And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
605	39675	74	
605	39676	75	[Outro]
605	39677	76	The end
606	39278	1	[Verse 1]
606	39279	2	Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
606	39280	3	And it's so quiet in the world tonight
606	39281	4	Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
606	39282	5	So I tuck you in, turn on your favourite nightlight
606	39283	6	
606	39284	7	[Pre-Chorus]
606	39285	8	To you, everything's funny
606	39286	9	You got nothing to regret
606	39287	10	I'd give all I have, honey
606	39288	11	If you could stay like that
606	39289	12	
606	39290	13	[Chorus]
606	39291	14	Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
606	39292	15	Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
606	39293	16	Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
606	39294	17	Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
606	39295	18	I won't let nobody hurt you
606	39296	19	Won't let no one break your heart
606	39297	20	And no one will desert you
606	39298	21	Just try to never grow up
606	39299	22	
606	39300	23	[Post-Chorus]
606	39301	24	And never grow up
606	39302	25	
606	39303	26	[Verse 2]
606	39304	27	You're in the car, on the way to the movies
606	39305	28	And you're mortified your mom's droppin' you off
606	39306	29	At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
606	39307	30	And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
606	39308	31	[Pre-Chorus]
606	39309	32	But don't make her drop you off around the block
606	39310	33	Remember that she's gettin' older, too
606	39311	34	And don't lose the way that you dance around
606	39312	35	In your PJs getting ready for school
606	39313	36	
606	39314	37	[Chorus]
606	39315	38	Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
606	39316	39	Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
606	39317	40	Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
606	39318	41	Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
606	39319	42	And no one's ever burned you
606	39320	43	Nothing's ever left you scarred
606	39321	44	And even though you want to
606	39322	45	Just try to never grow up
606	39323	46	
606	39324	47	[Bridge]
606	39325	48	Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
606	39326	49	Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
606	39327	50	Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
606	39328	51	And all your little brother's favorite songs
606	39329	52	I just realized everything I have is, someday, gonna be gone
606	39330	53	
606	39331	54	[Verse 3]
606	39332	55	So, here I am in my new apartment
606	39333	56	In a big city, they just dropped me off
606	39334	57	It's so much colder than I thought it would be
606	39335	58	So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
606	39336	59	[Chorus]
606	39337	60	Wish I'd never grown up
606	39338	61	Wish I'd never grown up
606	39339	62	Oh, I don't wanna grow up
606	39340	63	Wish I'd never grown up, I could still be little
606	39341	64	Oh, I don't wanna grow up
606	39342	65	Wish I'd never grown up, it could still be simple
606	39343	66	Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
606	39344	67	Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
606	39345	68	Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
606	39346	69	Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
606	39347	70	I won't let nobody hurt you (Never grow up)
606	39348	71	Won't let no one break your heart
606	39349	72	And even though you want to
606	39350	73	Please, try to never grow up
606	39351	74	
606	39352	75	[Outro]
606	39353	76	Oh, oh (Never grow up)
606	39354	77	Just never grow up
606	39355	78	Oh (Never grow up)
606	39356	79	Just never grow up
607	38652	1	[Verse 1]
607	38653	2	There I was again tonight
607	38654	3	Forcing laughter, faking smiles
607	38655	4	Same old tired, lonely place
607	38656	5	Walls of insincerity
607	38657	6	Shifting eyes and vacancy
607	38658	7	Vanished when I saw your face
607	38659	8	All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
607	38660	9	
607	38661	10	[Verse 2]
607	38662	11	Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
607	38663	12	Across the room, your silhouette
607	38664	13	Starts to make its way to me
607	38665	14	The playful conversation starts
607	38666	15	Counter all your quick remarks
607	38667	16	Like passing notes in secrecy
607	38668	17	And it was enchanting to meet you
607	38669	18	All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
607	38670	19	
607	38671	20	[Chorus]
607	38672	21	This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
607	38673	22	I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
607	38674	23	I'll spеnd forever wonderin' if you knеw
607	38675	24	I was enchanted to meet you
607	38676	25	
607	38677	26	[Verse 3]
607	38678	27	The lingering question kept me up
607	38679	28	2AM, who do you love?
607	38680	29	I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
607	38681	30	And now, I'm pacing back and forth
607	38682	31	Wishing you were at my door
607	38683	32	I'd open up and you would say
607	38684	33	"Hey, it was enchanting to meet you"
607	38685	34	All I know is I was enchanted to meet you
607	38686	35	[Chorus]
607	38687	36	This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
607	38688	37	I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
607	38689	38	I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
607	38690	39	This night is flawless, don't you let it go
607	38691	40	I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
607	38692	41	I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
607	38693	42	I was enchanted to meet you
607	38694	43	
607	38695	44	[Bridge]
607	38696	45	This is me praying that
607	38697	46	This was the very first page
607	38698	47	Not where the storyline ends
607	38699	48	My thoughts will echo your name
607	38700	49	Until I see you again
607	38701	50	These are the words I held back
607	38702	51	As I was leaving too soon
607	38703	52	I was enchanted to meet you
607	38704	53	Please, don't be in love with someone else
607	38705	54	Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you
607	38706	55	Please, don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)
607	38707	56	Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you (Oh-oh)
607	38708	57	
607	38709	58	[Chorus]
607	38710	59	This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
607	38711	60	I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
607	38712	61	I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
607	38713	62	This night is flawless (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
607	38714	63	Don't you let it go
607	38715	64	I'm wonderstruck (Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you)
607	38716	65	Dancing around all alone
607	38717	66	I'll spend forever (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
607	38718	67	Wonderin' if you knew
607	38719	68	I was enchanted to meet you
607	38720	69	[Outro]
607	38721	70	Please, don't be in love with someone else
607	38722	71	Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you
608	38417	1	[Intro]
608	38418	2	Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did (Haha)
608	38419	3	Haha, time for a little revenge
608	38420	4	
608	38421	5	[Verse 1]
608	38422	6	The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and
608	38423	7	I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
608	38424	8	She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
608	38425	9	She took him faster than you can say "Sabotage"
608	38426	10	I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
608	38427	11	I underestimated just who I was dealing with (Oh)
608	38428	12	She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
608	38429	13	She underestimated just who she was stealin' from
608	38430	14	
608	38431	15	[Chorus]
608	38432	16	She's not a saint and she's not what you think
608	38433	17	She's an actress, woah
608	38434	18	He was a moth to the flame
608	38435	19	She was holding the matches, woah
608	38436	20	Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
608	38437	21	On the playground won't make you many friends
608	38438	22	She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
608	38439	23	There is nothing I do better than revenge (Revenge), ha
608	38440	24	
608	38441	25	[Verse 2]
608	38442	26	She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
608	38443	27	She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
608	38444	28	I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and
608	38445	29	She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
608	38446	30	But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
608	38447	31	Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
608	38448	32	They didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
608	38449	33	But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
608	38450	34	(Think about what you did)
608	38451	35	[Chorus]
608	38452	36	She's not a saint and she's not what you think
608	38453	37	She's an actress, woah
608	38454	38	He was a moth to the flame
608	38455	39	She was holding the matches, woah
608	38456	40	Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
608	38457	41	On the playground won't make you many friends
608	38458	42	She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
608	38459	43	There is nothing I do better than revenge (Haha)
608	38460	44	
608	38461	45	[Bridge]
608	38462	46	I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
608	38463	47	You might have him, but haven't you heard?
608	38464	48	I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
608	38465	49	You might have him, but I always get the last word
608	38466	50	Woah (Come on, can you take it back? Come on)
608	38467	51	
608	38468	52	[Chorus]
608	38469	53	She's not a saint and she's not what you think (No)
608	38470	54	She's an actress, woah (She deserved it)
608	38471	55	He was a moth to the flame
608	38472	56	She was holding the matches, woah
608	38473	57	Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
608	38474	58	On the playground won't make you many friends
608	38475	59	She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
608	38476	60	There is nothing I do better than revenge
608	38477	61	[Outro]
608	38478	62	(Come on) Do you still feel like you know what you're doin'?
608	38479	63	'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)
608	38480	64	Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)
608	38481	65	I don't think you do, I don't think you do
608	38482	66	Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on)
608	38483	67	Come on, show me how much better you are (Oh, oh)
608	38484	68	(So much better, yeah?)
608	38485	69	So you deserve some applause
608	38486	70	'Cause you're so much better
608	38487	71	She took him faster than you could say "Sabotage"
609	38937	1	[Verse 1]
609	38938	2	I guess you really did it this time
609	38939	3	Left yourself in your war path
609	38940	4	Lost your balance on a tightrope
609	38941	5	Lost your mind tryin' to get it back
609	38942	6	[Pre-Chorus]
609	38943	7	Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
609	38944	8	Always a bigger bed to crawl into
609	38945	9	Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
609	38946	10	And everybody believed in you?
609	38947	11	
609	38948	12	[Chorus]
609	38949	13	It's alright, just wait and see
609	38950	14	Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
609	38951	15	Who you are is not where you've been
609	38952	16	You're still an innocent
609	38953	17	You're still an innocent
609	38954	18	
609	38955	19	[Verse 2]
609	38956	20	Did some things you can't speak of
609	38957	21	But at night, you live it all again
609	38958	22	You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
609	38959	23	If only you had seen what you know now then
609	38960	24	
609	38961	25	[Pre-Chorus]
609	38962	26	Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
609	38963	27	When everything out of reach
609	38964	28	Someone bigger brought down to you
609	38965	29	Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
609	38966	30	Before the monsters caught up to you?
609	38967	31	[Chorus]
609	38968	32	It's alright, just wait and see
609	38969	33	Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
609	38970	34	Who you are is not where you've been
609	38971	35	You're still an innocent
609	38972	36	It's okay, life is a tough crowd
609	38973	37	Thirty-two and still growing up now
609	38974	38	Who you are is not what you did
609	38975	39	You're still an innocent
609	38976	40	
609	38977	41	[Bridge]
609	38978	42	Time turns flames to embers
609	38979	43	You'll have new Septembers
609	38980	44	Every one of us has messed up, too, ooh
609	38981	45	Minds change like the weather
609	38982	46	I hope you remember
609	38983	47	Today is never too late to be brand new
609	38984	48	Oh, oh
609	38985	49	
609	38986	50	[Chorus]
609	38987	51	It's alright, just wait and see
609	38988	52	Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
609	38989	53	Who you are is not where you've been
609	38990	54	You're still an innocent
609	38991	55	It's okay, life is a tough crowd
609	38992	56	Thirty-two and still growing up now
609	38993	57	Who you are is not what you did
609	38994	58	You're still an innocent
609	38995	59	You're still an innocent
609	38996	60	[Outro]
609	38997	61	Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh
609	38998	62	It's never too late to get it back
610	38799	1	[Verse 1]
610	38800	2	You and I walk a fragile line
610	38801	3	I have known it all this time
610	38802	4	But I never thought I'd live to see it break
610	38803	5	It's getting dark and it's all so quiet
610	38804	6	And I can't trust anything now
610	38805	7	And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake
610	38806	8	
610	38807	9	[Pre-Chorus]
610	38808	10	Oh, holding my breath
610	38809	11	Won't lose you again
610	38810	12	Something's made your eyes go cold
610	38811	13	
610	38812	14	[Chorus]
610	38813	15	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
610	38814	16	I thought I had you figured out
610	38815	17	Something's gone terribly wrong
610	38816	18	You're all I wanted
610	38817	19	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
610	38818	20	I thought I had you figured out
610	38819	21	Can't breathe whenever you're gone
610	38820	22	Can't turn back now, I'm haunted
610	38821	23	
610	38822	24	[Verse 2]
610	38823	25	Stood there and watched you walk away
610	38824	26	From everything we had
610	38825	27	But I still mean every word I said to you
610	38826	28	He will try to take away my pain
610	38827	29	And he just might make me smile
610	38828	30	But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead
610	38829	31	[Pre-Chorus]
610	38830	32	Oh, holding my breath
610	38831	33	Won't see you again
610	38832	34	Something keeps me holding onto nothing
610	38833	35	
610	38834	36	[Chorus]
610	38835	37	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
610	38836	38	I thought I had you figured out
610	38837	39	Something's gone terribly wrong
610	38838	40	You're all I wanted
610	38839	41	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
610	38840	42	I thought I had you figured out
610	38841	43	Can't breathe whenever you're gone
610	38842	44	I can't turn back now, I'm haunted
610	38843	45	
610	38844	46	[Bridge]
610	38845	47	I know, I know
610	38846	48	I just know
610	38847	49	You're not gone
610	38848	50	You can't be gone, no
610	38849	51	
610	38850	52	[Chorus]
610	38851	53	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
610	38852	54	I thought I had you figured out
610	38853	55	Something's gone terribly wrong (Terribly wrong)
610	38854	56	Won't finish what you started
610	38855	57	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
610	38856	58	I thought I had you figured out
610	38857	59	Can't breathe whenever you're gone
610	38858	60	I can't go back, I'm haunted
610	38859	61	[Outro]
610	38860	62	Oh
610	38861	63	You and I walk a fragile line
610	38862	64	I have known it all this time
610	38863	65	Never ever thought I'd see it break
610	38864	66	Never thought I'd see it
611	38999	1	[Verse 1]
611	39000	2	I still remember the look on your face
611	39001	3	Lit through the darkness at 1:58
611	39002	4	The words that you whispered for just us to know
611	39003	5	You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
611	39004	6	Away
611	39005	7	
611	39006	8	[Verse 2]
611	39007	9	I do recall now, the smell of the rain
611	39008	10	Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
611	39009	11	That July ninth, the beat of your heart
611	39010	12	It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms
611	39011	13	
611	39012	14	[Pre-Chorus]
611	39013	15	But now I'll go
611	39014	16	Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
611	39015	17	All that I know is I don't know
611	39016	18	How to be somethin' you miss
611	39017	19	
611	39018	20	[Chorus]
611	39019	21	I never thought we'd have a last kiss
611	39020	22	I never imagined we'd end like this
611	39021	23	Your name, forever the name on my lips
611	39022	24	
611	39023	25	[Verse 3]
611	39024	26	I do remember the swing of your step
611	39025	27	The life of the party, you're showin' off again
611	39026	28	And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
611	39027	29	I'm not much for dancin', but for you, I did
611	39028	30	Because I love your handshake, meetin' my father
611	39029	31	I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
611	39030	32	How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
611	39031	33	There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions
611	39032	34	[Pre-Chorus]
611	39033	35	And I'll go
611	39034	36	Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
611	39035	37	All that I know is I don't know
611	39036	38	How to be somethin' you miss
611	39037	39	
611	39038	40	[Chorus]
611	39039	41	I never thought we'd have a last kiss
611	39040	42	I never imagined we'd end like this
611	39041	43	Your name, forever the name on my lips, mmm
611	39042	44	
611	39043	45	[Bridge]
611	39044	46	So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
611	39045	47	And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
611	39046	48	And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
611	39047	49	Hope it's nice where you are
611	39048	50	And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
611	39049	51	And something reminds you you wish you had stayed
611	39050	52	You can plan for a change in the weather and time
611	39051	53	But I never planned on you changing your mind
611	39052	54	
611	39053	55	[Pre-Chorus]
611	39054	56	So I'll go
611	39055	57	Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
611	39056	58	All that I know is I don't know
611	39057	59	How to be somethin' you miss
611	39058	60	[Chorus]
611	39059	61	I never thought we'd have a last kiss
611	39060	62	I never imagined we'd end like this
611	39061	63	Your name, forever the name on my lips
611	39062	64	
611	39063	65	[Outro]
611	39064	66	Just like our last kiss
611	39065	67	Forever the name on my lips
611	39066	68	Forever the name on my lips
611	39067	69	Just like our last
612	39068	1	[Verse 1]
612	39069	2	I said, "Remember this moment"
612	39070	3	In the back of my mind
612	39071	4	The time we stood with our shaking hands
612	39072	5	The crowds in stands went wild
612	39073	6	We were the kings and the queens
612	39074	7	And they read off our names
612	39075	8	The night you danced like you knew our lives would
612	39076	9	Never be the same
612	39077	10	You held your head like a hero on a history book page
612	39078	11	It was the end of a decade
612	39079	12	But the start of an age
612	39080	13	
612	39081	14	[Chorus]
612	39082	15	Long live the walls we crashеd through
612	39083	16	How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
612	39084	17	I was scrеaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
612	39085	18	And bring on all the pretenders
612	39086	19	One day, we will be remembered
612	39087	20	
612	39088	21	[Verse 2]
612	39089	22	I said, "Remember this feeling"
612	39090	23	I pass the pictures around
612	39091	24	Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
612	39092	25	Wishin' for right now
612	39093	26	We are the kings and the queens
612	39094	27	You traded your baseball cap for a crown
612	39095	28	When they gave us our trophies
612	39096	29	And we held them up for our town
612	39097	30	And the cynics were outraged
612	39098	31	Screaming, "This is absurd"
612	39099	32	'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
612	39100	33	In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
612	39101	34	[Chorus]
612	39102	35	Long live the walls we crashed through
612	39103	36	How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
612	39104	37	I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
612	39105	38	And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
612	39106	39	Long live all the mountains we moved
612	39107	40	I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
612	39108	41	I was screaming, "Long live that look on your face"
612	39109	42	And bring on all the pretenders
612	39110	43	One day, we will be remembered
612	39111	44	
612	39112	45	[Bridge]
612	39113	46	Hold on to spinning around
612	39114	47	Confetti falls to the ground
612	39115	48	May these memories break our fall
612	39116	49	Will you take a moment? Promise me this
612	39117	50	That you'll stand by me forever
612	39118	51	But if, God forbid, fate should step in
612	39119	52	And force us into a goodbye
612	39120	53	If you have children some day
612	39121	54	When they point to the pictures
612	39122	55	Please, tell 'em my name
612	39123	56	Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
612	39124	57	Tell 'em how I hope they shine
612	39125	58	Long live the walls we crashed through
612	39126	59	I had the time of my life with you
612	39127	60	[Chorus]
612	39128	61	Long, long live the walls we crashed through
612	39129	62	How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
612	39130	63	And I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
612	39131	64	And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
612	39132	65	Singing, "Long live all the mountains we moved"
612	39133	66	I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
612	39134	67	And long, long live that look on your face
612	39135	68	And bring on all the pretenders
612	39136	69	One day, we will be remembered
613	39357	1	[Verse 1]
613	39358	2	Elevator buttons and morning air
613	39359	3	Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
613	39360	4	If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
613	39361	5	But right now, my time is theirs
613	39362	6	Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
613	39363	7	They'll judge it like they know about me and you
613	39364	8	And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
613	39365	9	The jury's out, but my choice is you
613	39366	10	
613	39367	11	[Chorus]
613	39368	12	So don't you worry your pretty little mind
613	39369	13	People throw rocks at things that shine
613	39370	14	And life makes love look hard
613	39371	15	The stakes are high, the water's rough
613	39372	16	But this love is ours
613	39373	17	
613	39374	18	[Verse 2]
613	39375	19	You never know what people have up their sleeves
613	39376	20	Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
613	39377	21	Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
613	39378	22	But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
613	39379	23	And you'll say
613	39380	24	
613	39381	25	[Chorus]
613	39382	26	Don't you worry your pretty little mind
613	39383	27	People throw rocks at things that shine
613	39384	28	And life makes love look hard
613	39385	29	The stakes are high, the water's rough
613	39386	30	But this love is ours
613	39387	31	[Bridge]
613	39388	32	And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
613	39389	33	Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
613	39390	34	I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
613	39391	35	'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
613	39392	36	And I love the riddles that you speak
613	39393	37	And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
613	39394	38	Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours
613	39395	39	
613	39396	40	[Chorus]
613	39397	41	So don't you worry your pretty little mind
613	39398	42	People throw rocks at things that shine
613	39399	43	And life makes love look hard
613	39400	44	Don't you worry your pretty little mind
613	39401	45	People throw rocks at things that shine
613	39402	46	But they can't take what's ours
613	39403	47	They can't take what's ours
613	39404	48	The stakes are high, the water's rough
613	39405	49	But this love is ours
614	39534	1	[Verse 1]
614	39535	2	Tall, dark, and superman
614	39536	3	He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
614	39537	4	To save the world or go to work
614	39538	5	It's the same thing to me
614	39539	6	He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
614	39540	7	I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
614	39541	8	I hang on every word you say, yay
614	39542	9	And you smile and say, "How are you?”
614	39543	10	And I'll say, "Just fine"
614	39544	11	I always forget to tell you, "I love you"
614	39545	12	I love you forever
614	39546	13	
614	39547	14	[Chorus]
614	39548	15	I watch superman fly away
614	39549	16	You've got a busy day today
614	39550	17	Go save the world, I'll be around
614	39551	18	And I watch superman fly away
614	39552	19	Come back, I'll be with you someday
614	39553	20	I'll be right here on the ground
614	39554	21	When you come back down
614	39555	22	
614	39556	23	[Verse 2]
614	39557	24	Tall, dark and beautiful
614	39558	25	He's complicated, he's irrational
614	39559	26	But I hope someday you'll take me away, and save the day, yeah
614	39560	27	Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
614	39561	28	He's not all bad like his reputation
614	39562	29	And I can't hear one single word they say
614	39563	30	And you'll leave, got places to be, and I'll be okay
614	39564	31	I always forget to tell you, "I love you"
614	39565	32	I loved you from the very first day
614	39566	33	[Chorus]
614	39567	34	I watch superman fly away
614	39568	35	You've got a busy day today
614	39569	36	Go save the world, I'll be around
614	39570	37	And I watch superman fly away
614	39571	38	Come back, I'll be with you someday
614	39572	39	I'll be right here on the ground
614	39573	40	When you come back down
614	39574	41	
614	39575	42	[Bridge]
614	39576	43	And I watch you fly around the world
614	39577	44	And I hope you don't save some other girl
614	39578	45	Don't forget, don't forget about me
614	39579	46	I'm far away, but I never let you go
614	39580	47	I'm love-struck and looking out the window
614	39581	48	Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
614	39582	49	
614	39583	50	[Breakdown]
614	39584	51	Right here, wishing the flowers were from you
614	39585	52	Wishing the card was from you
614	39586	53	Wishing the call was from you
614	39587	54	'Cause I loved you from the very first day
614	39588	55	
614	39589	56	[Chorus]
614	39590	57	I watch superman fly away
614	39591	58	You've got a busy day today
614	39592	59	Go save the world, I'll be around
614	39593	60	Forever and ever
614	39594	61	And I watch superman fly away
614	39595	62	I swear, I'll be with you someday
614	39596	63	I'll be right here on the ground

614	39601	68	When you come back down
615	38606	1	[From The Vault]
615	38607	2	Just breathe, just relax, it'll be okay
615	38608	3	Just an hour 'til your car's in the driveway
615	38609	4	Just the first time ever hangin' out with you tonight
615	38610	5	I've got my money on things goin' badly
615	38611	6	Got a history of stories ending sadly
615	38612	7	Still hoping that the fire won't burn me
615	38613	8	Just one time, just one time
615	38614	9	
615	38615	10	[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
615	38616	11	All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
615	38617	12	Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
615	38618	13	And I want you now, wanna need you forever
615	38619	14	In the heat of your electric touch, mmm
615	38620	15	
615	38621	16	[Verse 2: Patrick Stump, Taylor Swift & Patrick Stump]
615	38622	17	I've been left in the rain lost and pining
615	38623	18	I'm tryin' hard not to look like I'm trying
615	38624	19	'Cause every time I tried hard for love, it fell apart (Woah)
615	38625	20	I've gotten used to no one callin' my phone
615	38626	21	I've grown accustomed to sleepin' alone
615	38627	22	Still, I know that all it takes is to get it right
615	38628	23	Just one time, just one time
615	38629	24	
615	38630	25	[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Patrick Stump]
615	38631	26	All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
615	38632	27	Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
615	38633	28	And I want you now, wanna need you forever
615	38634	29	In the heat of your electric touch, mmm
615	38635	30	[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Patrick Stump]
615	38636	31	I was thinking just one time (Just one time)
615	38637	32	Maybe the stars align (Just one time)
615	38638	33	And maybe I call you mine
615	38639	34	And you won't need space
615	38640	35	Or string me along while you decide
615	38641	36	And just one time (Just one time)
615	38642	37	Maybe the moment's right (The moment's right)
615	38643	38	It's 8:05 and I see two headlights
615	38644	39	
615	38645	40	[Chorus: Both, Taylor Swift, Patrick Stump]
615	38646	41	All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
615	38647	42	Got a feelin' your electric touch (Ooh)
615	38648	43	All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
615	38649	44	Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life (Life)
615	38650	45	And I want you now, wanna need you forever

616	39758	2	When Emma falls in love, she paces the floor
616	39759	3	Closes the blinds and locks the door
616	39760	4	When Emma falls in love, she calls up her mom
616	39761	5	Jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong
616	39762	6	She waits and takes her time
616	39763	7	'Cause Little Miss Sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain
616	39764	8	When Emma falls in love, I know
616	39765	9	That boy will never be the same
616	39766	10	
616	39767	11	[Chorus]
616	39768	12	'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
616	39769	13	Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
616	39770	14	And all the bad boys would be good boys
616	39771	15	If they only had a chance to love her
616	39772	16	And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her
616	39773	17	
616	39774	18	[Verse 2]
616	39775	19	When Emma falls in love, it's all on her face
616	39776	20	Hangs in the air like stars in outer space
616	39777	21	When Emma falls in love, she disappears
616	39778	22	And we all just laugh after seein' it all these years
616	39779	23	When Emma falls apart, it's when she's alone
616	39780	24	She takes on the pain and bears it on her own
616	39781	25	'Cause when Emma falls in love, she's in it for keeps
616	39782	26	She won't walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave
616	39783	27	[Chorus]
616	39784	28	And she's the kind of book that you can't put down
616	39785	29	Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
616	39786	30	And all the bad boys would be good boys
616	39787	31	If they only had a chance to love her
616	39788	32	And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her
616	39789	33	
616	39790	34	[Bridge]
616	39791	35	Well, she's so New York when she's in L.A.​​
616	39792	36	She won't lose herself in love the way that I did
616	39793	37	'Cause she'll call you out, she'll put you in your place
616	39794	38	When Emma falls in love, I'm learning
616	39795	39	
616	39796	40	[Verse 3]
616	39797	41	Emma met a boy with eyes like a man
616	39798	42	Turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand
616	39799	43	Now he'll be her shelter when it rains
616	39800	44	Little does he know, his whole world's about to change
616	39801	45	
616	39802	46	[Chorus]
616	39803	47	'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down

617	38866	2	Uh-uh, uh, uh
617	38867	3	
617	38868	4	[Verse 1]
617	38869	5	You brush past me in the hallway
617	38870	6	And you don't think I, I, I can see ya, do ya?
617	38871	7	I’ve been watchin' you for ages
617	38872	8	And I spend my time tryin' not to feel it
617	38873	9	
617	38874	10	[Pre-Chorus]
617	38875	11	But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
617	38876	12	What would you do if they never found us out?
617	38877	13	What would you do if we never made a sound?
617	38878	14	
617	38879	15	[Chorus]
617	38880	16	’Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
617	38881	17	And I could see you up against the wall with me
617	38882	18	And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew
617	38883	19	That I can see you
617	38884	20	
617	38885	21	[Post-Chorus]
617	38886	22	Uh-uh, uh, uh
617	38887	23	
617	38888	24	[Verse 2]
617	38889	25	And we kept everything professional
617	38890	26	But something's changed, it's somethin' I, I like
617	38891	27	They keep watchful eyes on us
617	38892	28	So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet
617	38893	29	You won't believe half the things I see inside my head
617	38894	30	Wait 'til you see half the things that haven’t happened yet
617	38895	31	[Pre-Chorus]
617	38896	32	But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
617	38897	33	What would you do if they never found us out?
617	38898	34	What would you do if we never made a sound?
617	38899	35	
617	38900	36	[Chorus]

617	38903	39	And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew, oh, oh, oh
617	38904	40	That I could see you throw your jacket on the floor
617	38905	41	I could see you, make me want you even more
617	38906	42	What would you do? Baby, if you only knew

617	38912	48	[Bridge]
617	38913	49	I can see you in your suit and your necktie
617	38914	50	Passed me a note saying, "Meet me tonight"
617	38915	51	Then we kissed and you know I won’t ever tell, yeah
617	38916	52	And I could see you being my addiction
617	38917	53	You can see me as a secret mission
617	38918	54	Hide away and I will start behaving myself
617	38919	55

617	38929	65	What would you do? Baby, if you only knew

618	38494	7	Once, I had an empire in a golden age
618	38495	8	I was held up so high, I used to be great
618	38496	9	They used to cheer when they saw my face
618	38497	10	Now, I fear I have fallen from grace
618	38498	11	
618	38499	12	[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams]
618	38500	13	And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
618	38501	14	And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground

618	38505	18	[Verse 2: Hayley Williams, Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams]
618	38506	19	Once, I was the great hope for a dynasty
618	38507	20	Crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me
618	38508	21	Their faith was strong, but I pushed it too far
618	38509	22	I held that grudge 'til it tore me apart
618	38510	23	
618	38511	24	[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams, Taylor Swift]
618	38512	25	Power went to my head and I couldn't stop
618	38513	26	Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off
618	38514	27	And here I sit alone behind walls of regret
618	38515	28	Falling down like promises that I never kept
618	38516	29	[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams, Taylor Swift]
618	38517	30	And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
618	38518	31	And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground

618	38522	35	[Bridge: Taylor Swift]
618	38523	36	My foes and friends watch my reign end
618	38524	37	I don't know how it could've ended this way
618	38525	38	Smoke billows from my ships in the harbor
618	38526	39	People look at me like I'm a monster
618	38527	40	Now they're screamin' at the palace's front gates
618	38528	41	Used to chant my name
618	38529	42	Now they're screaming that they hate me
618	38530	43	Never wanted you to hate me
618	38531	44	
618	38532	45	[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams]
618	38533	46	My castle's crumbling down

619	38724	2	My cards are on the table, yours are in your hand
619	38725	3	Chances are, tonight, you've already got plans
619	38726	4	And chances are I will talk myself to sleep again
619	38727	5	You give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high
619	38728	6	Wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right
619	38729	7	And I will block out these voices of reason in my head
619	38730	8	
619	38731	9	[Pre-Chorus]
619	38732	10	And the voices say, "You are not the exception

619	38735	13	[Chorus]

619	38740	18	
619	38741	19	[Verse 2]
619	38742	20	You know how to keep me waitin'
619	38743	21	I know how to act like I'm fine
619	38744	22	Don't know what to call this situation
619	38745	23	But I know I can't call you mine
619	38746	24	And it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof
619	38747	25	'Cause when my head is on your shoulder
619	38748	26	It starts thinkin' you'll come around
619	38749	27	And maybe, someday, when we're older
619	38750	28	This is something we'll laugh about
619	38751	29	Over coffee every mornin' while you're watching the news
619	38752	30	[Pre-Chorus]
619	38753	31	But then the voices say, "You are not the exception

619	38763	41	That ain't never gonna come
619	38764	42	You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out
619	38765	43	
619	38766	44	[Bridge]
619	38767	45	Now I'm slidin' down the wall with my head in my hands
619	38768	46	Sayin', "How could I not see the signs?"
619	38769	47	Oh, you haven't written me or called
619	38770	48	But goodbye screamin' in the silence
619	38771	49	And the voices in my head are tellin' me why
619	38772	50	'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings
619	38773	51	I'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring
619	38774	52	And you will say you had the best of intentions
619	38775	53	And maybe I will finally learn my lesson
619	38776	54	
619	38777	55	[Chorus]

619	38787	65	La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, oh
619	38788	66	La-la-la-la-la
619	38789	67	Ain't never gonna come
619	38790	68	Ooh, you will learn the hard way now
619	38791	69	Foolish one
619	38792	70	Sittin' 'round waiting for confessions of love
619	38793	71	They ain't never gonna come
619	38794	72	And thinkin' he's the one, you should've been walkin' out
619	38795	73	Foolish one
619	38796	74	The day is gonna come for your confessions of love
619	38797	75	When all is said and done, he just wasn't the one
619	38798	76	No, he just wasn't the one
620	39678	1	[From The Vault]
620	39679	2	Down the block, there's an antique shop
620	39680	3	And something in my head said, "Stop," so I walked in
620	39681	4	On the counter was a cardboard box
620	39682	5	And the sign said, "Photos: twenty-five cents each"
620	39683	6	Black and white, saw a '30s bride
620	39684	7	And school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house
620	39685	8	The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime
620	39686	9	The kind you don't put down
620	39687	10	And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain
620	39688	11	But in those photos, I saw us instead
620	39689	12	And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other
620	39690	13	In another life, you still would've turned my head even if wе'd met
620	39691	14	
620	39692	15	[Chorus]
620	39693	16	On a crowded street in 1944
620	39694	17	And you werе headed off to fight in the war
620	39695	18	You still would've been mine
620	39696	19	We would have been timeless
620	39697	20	I would've read your love letters every single night
620	39698	21	And prayed to God you'd be comin' home all right
620	39699	22	And you would've been fine
620	39700	23	We would have been timeless
620	39701	24	'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
620	39702	25	So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
620	39703	26	We would've been timeless
620	39704	27	[Verse 2]
620	39705	28	I had to smile when it caught my eye
620	39706	29	There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway
620	39707	30	Holdin' hands on the way to a dance
620	39708	31	And the date on the back said 1958
620	39709	32	Which brought me back to the first time I saw you
620	39710	33	Time stood still like somethin' in this old shop
620	39711	34	I thought about it as I started lookin' 'round
620	39712	35	At these precious things that time forgot
620	39713	36	That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs
620	39714	37	Story of a romance torn apart by fate
620	39715	38	Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did
620	39716	39	And I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face
620	39717	40	
620	39718	41	[Chorus]
620	39719	42	In the fifteen hundreds off in a foreign land
620	39720	43	And I was forced to marry another man
620	39721	44	You still would've been mine
620	39722	45	We would have been timeless
620	39723	46	I would've read your love letters every single night
620	39724	47	And run away and left it all behind
620	39725	48	You still would've been mine
620	39726	49	We would've been timeless
620	39727	50	'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
620	39728	51	So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
620	39729	52	We would've been timeless
620	39730	53	[Bridge]
620	39731	54	Time breaks down your mind and body
620	39732	55	Don't you let it touch your soul
620	39733	56	It was like an age-old classic
620	39734	57	The first time that you saw me
620	39735	58	The story started when you said, "Hello"
620	39736	59	
620	39737	60	[Chorus]
620	39738	61	In a crowded room a few short years ago
620	39739	62	And sometimes there's no proof, you just know
620	39740	63	You're always gonna be mine
620	39741	64	We're gonna be
620	39742	65	I'm gonna love you when our hair is turnin' gray
620	39743	66	We'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made
620	39744	67	And you'll say, "Oh my, we really were timeless"
620	39745	68	
620	39746	69	[Post-Chorus]
620	39747	70	We're gonna be timeless, timeless
620	39748	71	You still would've been mine
620	39749	72	We would've been
620	39750	73	Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944
620	39751	74	You still would've been mine
620	39752	75	We would've been
620	39753	76	
620	39754	77	[Outro]
620	39755	78	Down the block, there's an antique shop
620	39756	79	And somethin' in my head said, "Stop," so I walked in
660	45298	1	[Verse 1]
660	45299	2	He said the way my blue eyes shined
660	45300	3	Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
660	45301	4	I said, "That's a lie"
660	45302	5	Just a boy in a Chevy truck
660	45303	6	That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
660	45304	7	On backroads at night
660	45305	8	And I was right there beside him all summer long
660	45306	9	And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
660	45307	10	
660	45308	11	[Chorus]
660	45309	12	But when you think Tim McGraw
660	45310	13	I hope you think my favorite song
660	45311	14	The one we danced to all night long
660	45312	15	The moon like a spotlight on the lake
660	45313	16	When you think happiness
660	45314	17	I hope you think that little black dress
660	45315	18	Think of my head on your chest
660	45316	19	And my old faded blue jeans
660	45317	20	When you think Tim McGraw
660	45318	21	I hope you think of me
660	45319	22	[Verse 2]
660	45320	23	September saw a month of tears
660	45321	24	And thankin' God that you weren't here
660	45322	25	To see me like that
660	45323	26	But in a box beneath my bed
660	45324	27	Is a letter that you never read
660	45325	28	From three summers back
660	45326	29	It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
660	45327	30	And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe
660	45328	31	
660	45329	32	[Chorus]
660	45330	33	When you think Tim McGraw
660	45331	34	I hope you think my favorite song
660	45332	35	The one we danced to all night long
660	45333	36	The moon like a spotlight on the lake
660	45334	37	When you think happiness
660	45335	38	I hope you think that little black dress
660	45336	39	Think of my head on your chest
660	45337	40	And my old faded blue jeans
660	45338	41	When you think Tim McGraw
660	45339	42	I hope you think of me
660	45340	43	
660	45341	44	[Bridge]
660	45342	45	And I'm back for the first time since then
660	45343	46	I'm standin' on your street
660	45344	47	And there's a letter left on your doorstep
660	45345	48	And the first thing that you'll read
660	45346	49	[Chorus]
660	45347	50	Is, "When you think Tim McGraw
660	45348	51	I hope you think my favorite song
660	45349	52	Someday you'll turn your radio on
660	45350	53	I hope it takes you back to that place"
660	45351	54	When you think happiness
660	45352	55	I hope you think that little black dress
660	45353	56	Think of my head on your chest
660	45354	57	And my old faded blue jeans
660	45355	58	When you think Tim McGraw
660	45356	59	I hope you think of me
660	45357	60	
660	45358	61	[Outro]
660	45359	62	Oh, think of me, mmm
660	45360	63	He said the way my blue eyes shined
660	45361	64	Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
660	45362	65	I said, "That's a lie"2
661	44867	1	[Verse 1]
661	44868	2	State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
661	44869	3	I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
661	44870	4	So, go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
661	44871	5	That's fine, you won't mind if I say
661	44872	6	By the way
661	44873	7	
661	44874	8	[Chorus]
661	44875	9	I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
661	44876	10	You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
661	44877	11	So, watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
661	44878	12	As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
661	44879	13	[Verse 2]
661	44880	14	There's no time for tears, I'm just sittin' here planning my revenge
661	44881	15	There's nothing stoppin' me from goin' out with all of your best friends
661	44882	16	And if you come around sayin' sorry to me
661	44883	17	My daddy's gonna show ya how sorry you'll be
661	44884	18	
661	44885	19	[Chorus]
661	44886	20	'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
661	44887	21	You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
661	44888	22	So, watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
661	44889	23	As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
661	44890	24	
661	44891	25	[Bridge]
661	44892	26	And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
661	44893	27	'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health
661	44894	28	
661	44895	29	[Chorus]
661	44896	30	'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
661	44897	31	You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
661	44898	32	So, watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
661	44899	33	In case you haven't heard
661	44900	34	I really, really hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
661	44901	35	You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
661	44902	36	So, watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
661	44903	37	As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
661	44904	38	[Outro]
661	44905	39	Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
661	44906	40	You're just another picture to burn
661	44907	41	Baby, burn3
662	45088	1	[Verse 1]
662	45089	2	Drew looks at me
662	45090	3	I fake a smile, so he won't see
662	45091	4	That I want and I'm needing
662	45092	5	Everything that we should be
662	45093	6	
662	45094	7	[Pre-Chorus]
662	45095	8	I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
662	45096	9	And she's got everything that I have to live without
662	45097	10	
662	45098	11	[Verse 2]
662	45099	12	Drew talks to me
662	45100	13	I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
662	45101	14	That I can't even see
662	45102	15	Anyone when he's with me
662	45103	16	[Pre-Chorus]
662	45104	17	He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
662	45105	18	I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
662	45106	19	
662	45107	20	[Chorus]
662	45108	21	He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
662	45109	22	The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
662	45110	23	He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
662	45111	24	
662	45112	25	[Verse 3]
662	45113	26	Drew walks by me
662	45114	27	Can he tell that I can't breathe?
662	45115	28	And there he goes, so perfectly
662	45116	29	The kind of flawless I wish I could be
662	45117	30	
662	45118	31	[Pre-Chorus]
662	45119	32	She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
662	45120	33	Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
662	45121	34	
662	45122	35	[Chorus]
662	45123	36	He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
662	45124	37	The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
662	45125	38	He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
662	45126	39	
662	45127	40	[Pre-Chorus]
662	45128	41	So, I'll drive home alone as I turn off the light
662	45129	42	I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
662	45130	43	[Chorus]
662	45131	44	'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
662	45132	45	The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
662	45133	46	He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
662	45134	47	
662	45135	48	[Outro]
662	45136	49	He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
662	45137	50	And he's all that I need to fall into
662	45138	51	Drew looks at me
662	45139	52	I fake a smile, so he won't see5
663	44557	1	[Verse 1]
663	44558	2	I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
663	44559	3	'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
663	44560	4	Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
663	44561	5	Trying to see through the rain coming down
663	44562	6	Even though I'm not the only one
663	44563	7	Who feels the way I do
663	44564	8	
663	44565	9	[Chorus]
663	44566	10	I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
663	44567	11	I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
663	44568	12	Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
663	44569	13	[Verse 2]
663	44570	14	Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
663	44571	15	And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
663	44572	16	Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
663	44573	17	Could you tell me what more do I need?
663	44574	18	And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh, yeah
663	44575	19	But that's okay
663	44576	20	
663	44577	21	[Chorus]
663	44578	22	I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
663	44579	23	I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
663	44580	24	Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
663	44581	25	
663	44582	26	[Bridge]
663	44583	27	Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
663	44584	28	But I'm ready to fly
663	44585	29	
663	44586	30	[Chorus]
663	44587	31	I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
663	44588	32	I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
663	44589	33	Oh, I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
663	44590	34	Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
663	44591	35	
663	44592	36	[Outro]
663	44593	37	Oh, I'm just a girl
663	44594	38	Oh, I'm just a girl, oh, oh
663	44595	39	Oh, I'm just a girl
664	44596	1	[Verse 1]
664	44597	2	You have a way of coming easily to me
664	44598	3	And when you take, you take the very best of me
664	44599	4	So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
664	44600	5	And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted
664	44601	6	
664	44602	7	[Chorus]
664	44603	8	Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
664	44604	9	Just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
664	44605	10	And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
664	44606	11	I've never been anywhere cold as you
664	44607	12	[Verse 2]
664	44608	13	You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
664	44609	14	And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
664	44610	15	And you come away with a great little story
664	44611	16	Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
664	44612	17	
664	44613	18	[Chorus]
664	44614	19	Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
664	44615	20	So just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
664	44616	21	And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
664	44617	22	I've never been anywhere cold as you
664	44618	23	
664	44619	24	[Bridge]
664	44620	25	You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you
664	44621	26	And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you
664	44622	27	(Died for you)
664	44623	28	
664	44624	29	[Chorus]
664	44625	30	Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
664	44626	31	Every smile you fake is so condescending
664	44627	32	Counting all the scars you made
664	44628	33	And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
664	44629	34	I've never been anywhere cold as you
664	44630	35	Ooh1
665	45199	1	[Verse 1]
665	45200	2	I didn't know what I would find
665	45201	3	When I went looking for a reason, I know
665	45202	4	I didn't read between the lines
665	45203	5	And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
665	45204	6	
665	45205	7	[Pre-Chorus]
665	45206	8	I tried to take the road less traveled by
665	45207	9	But nothing seems to work the first few times
665	45208	10	Am I right?
665	45209	11	[Chorus]
665	45210	12	So how can I ever try to be better?
665	45211	13	Nobody ever lets me in
665	45212	14	I can still see you, this ain't the best view
665	45213	15	On the outside looking in
665	45214	16	I've been a lot of lonely places
665	45215	17	I've never been on the outside
665	45216	18	
665	45217	19	[Verse 2]
665	45218	20	You saw me there, but never knew
665	45219	21	That I would give it all up to be
665	45220	22	A part of this, a part of you
665	45221	23	And now it's all too late, so you see
665	45222	24	
665	45223	25	[Pre-Chorus]
665	45224	26	You could've helped if you had wanted to
665	45225	27	But no one notices until it's too
665	45226	28	Late to do anything
665	45227	29	
665	45228	30	[Chorus]
665	45229	31	How can I ever try to be better?
665	45230	32	Nobody ever lets me in
665	45231	33	I can still see you, this ain't the best view
665	45232	34	On the outside looking in
665	45233	35	I've been a lot of lonely places
665	45234	36	I've never been on the outside
665	45235	37	[Post-Chorus]
665	45236	38	Oh, yeah
665	45237	39	
665	45238	40	[Chorus]
665	45239	41	How can I ever try to be better?
665	45240	42	Nobody ever lets me in
665	45241	43	And I can still see you, this ain't the best view
665	45242	44	On the outside looking in
665	45243	45	I've been a lot of lonely places
665	45244	46	I've never been on the outside
665	45245	47	
665	45246	48	[Outro]
665	45247	49	Oh-oh
665	45248	50	Oh, oh-oh
665	45249	51	Oh-oh
665	45250	52	Oh-oh
666	45251	1	[Verse 1]
666	45252	2	Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
666	45253	3	Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
666	45254	4	You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
666	45255	5	But that's not true
666	45256	6	'Cause I know you
666	45257	7	
666	45258	8	[Chorus]
666	45259	9	Hold on, baby, you're losing it
666	45260	10	The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
666	45261	11	And no one knows
666	45262	12	That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
666	45263	13	That you might not be the golden one
666	45264	14	And you're tied together with a smile
666	45265	15	But you're coming undone, oh
666	45266	16	[Verse 2]
666	45267	17	I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
666	45268	18	'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
666	45269	19	Hoping it will end up in his pocket (Pocket)
666	45270	20	But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
666	45271	21	Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
666	45272	22	It's not his price to pay
666	45273	23	
666	45274	24	[Chorus]
666	45275	25	Hold on, baby, you're losing it
666	45276	26	The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
666	45277	27	And no one knows
666	45278	28	That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
666	45279	29	That you might not be the golden one
666	45280	30	And you're tied together with a smile
666	45281	31	But you're coming undone, oh
666	45282	32	Oh, oh
666	45283	33	
666	45284	34	[Chorus]
666	45285	35	Hold on, baby, you're losing it
666	45286	36	The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
666	45287	37	And no one knows
666	45288	38	That you cry but you don't tell anyone
666	45289	39	That you might not be the golden one
666	45290	40	And you're tied together with a smile
666	45291	41	But you're coming undone, oh
666	45292	42	[Outro]
666	45293	43	You're tied together with a smile
666	45294	44	But you're coming undone, oh, oh-oh
666	45295	45	Goodbye, baby
666	45296	46	With a smile, baby, baby
666	45297	47	Oh1
667	44971	1	[Verse 1]
667	44972	2	Corey's eyes are like a jungle
667	44973	3	He smiles, it's like the radio
667	44974	4	He whispers songs into my window
667	44975	5	In words that nobody knows
667	44976	6	There's pretty girls on every corner
667	44977	7	They watch him as he's walking home
667	44978	8	Saying, "Does he know?"
667	44979	9	Will you ever know?
667	44980	10	
667	44981	11	[Chorus]
667	44982	12	You're beautiful, every little piece, love
667	44983	13	Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
667	44984	14	Ask anyone
667	44985	15	And when you find everything you looked for
667	44986	16	I hope your life leads you back to my door
667	44987	17	Oh, but if it don't
667	44988	18	Stay beautiful
667	44989	19	[Verse 2]
667	44990	20	Cory finds another way to be
667	44991	21	The highlight of my day
667	44992	22	I'm taking pictures in my mind
667	44993	23	So I can save 'em for a rainy day
667	44994	24	It's hard to make a conversation
667	44995	25	When he's taking my breath away
667	44996	26	I should say, "Hey, by the way"
667	44997	27	
667	44998	28	[Chorus]
667	44999	29	You're beautiful, every little piece, love
667	45000	30	Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
667	45001	31	Ask anyone
667	45002	32	And when you find everything you looked for
667	45003	33	I hope your life leads you back to my door
667	45004	34	Oh, but if it don't
667	45005	35	Stay beautiful
667	45006	36	
667	45007	37	[Bridge]
667	45008	38	If you and I are a story
667	45009	39	That never gets told
667	45010	40	If what you are is a daydream
667	45011	41	I'll never get to hold, at least you'll know
667	45012	42	
667	45013	43	[Chorus]
667	45014	44	You're beautiful, every little piece, love
667	45015	45	Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
667	45016	46	Ask anyone
667	45017	47	And when you find everything you looked for
667	45018	48	I hope your life leads you back to my front door
667	45019	49	Oh, but if it don't
667	45020	50	Will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
667	45021	51	Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
667	45022	52	[Outro]
667	45023	53	La-la-la
667	45024	54	Oh-oh-oh
667	45025	55	Oh-oh-oh-oh
667	45026	56	Oh, but if it don't
667	45027	57	Stay beautiful, stay beautiful
667	45028	58	Na-na-na, na-na2
668	44908	1	[Verse 1]
668	44909	2	It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
668	44910	3	The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
668	44911	4	Yesterday, I found out about you
668	44912	5	Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong
668	44913	6	
668	44914	7	[Pre-Chorus]
668	44915	8	You say that you'd take it all back
668	44916	9	Given one chance
668	44917	10	It was a moment of weakness
668	44918	11	And you said yes
668	44919	12	[Chorus]
668	44920	13	You should've said no, you should've gone home
668	44921	14	You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
668	44922	15	You should've known that word
668	44923	16	'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me (Get back to me)
668	44924	17	And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
668	44925	18	I shouldn't be asking myself why
668	44926	19	You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
668	44927	20	You should've said no
668	44928	21	Baby, and you might still have me
668	44929	22	
668	44930	23	[Verse 2]
668	44931	24	You can see that I've been cryin'
668	44932	25	And baby, you know all the right things to say
668	44933	26	But do you honestly expect me to believe
668	44934	27	We could ever be the same?
668	44935	28	
668	44936	29	[Pre-Chorus]
668	44937	30	You say that the past is the past
668	44938	31	You need one chance
668	44939	32	It was a moment of weakness
668	44940	33	And you said yes
668	44941	34	
668	44942	35	[Chorus]
668	44943	36	You should've said no, you should've gone home
668	44944	37	You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
668	44945	38	You should've known that word

668	44949	42	You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
668	44950	43	You should've said no
668	44951	44	Baby, and you might still have me
668	44952	45	Oh, oh
668	44953	46	[Bridge]
668	44954	47	I can't resist
668	44955	48	Before you go, tell me this
668	44956	49	Was it worth it?
668	44957	50	Was she worth this?
668	44958	51	No, no
668	44959	52	No, no, no, no
668	44960	53	
668	44961	54	[Chorus]
668	44962	55	You should've said no, you should've gone home

668	44969	62	You should've said no
668	44970	63	Baby, and you might still have me2
670	44801	1	[Verse 1]
670	44802	2	I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
670	44803	3	In the front seat of his car
670	44804	4	He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
670	44805	5	The other on my heart
670	44806	6	I look around, turn the radio down
670	44807	7	He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
670	44808	8	I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin'
670	44809	9	How we don't have a song"
670	44810	10	And he says
670	44811	11	[Chorus]
670	44812	12	Our song is the slamming screen door
670	44813	13	Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
670	44814	14	When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
670	44815	15	'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
670	44816	16	Our song is the way you laugh
670	44817	17	The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
670	44818	18	And when I got home, 'fore I said amen
670	44819	19	Askin' God if he could play it again
670	44820	20	
670	44821	21	[Verse 2]
670	44822	22	I was walking up the front porch steps
670	44823	23	After everything that day
670	44824	24	Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
670	44825	25	And lost and thrown away
670	44826	26	Got to the hallway, well on my way
670	44827	27	To my lovin' bed
670	44828	28	I almost didn't notice all the roses
670	44829	29	And the note that said
670	44830	30	
670	44831	31	[Chorus]
670	44832	32	Our song is the slamming screen door
670	44833	33	Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
670	44834	34	When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
670	44835	35	'Cause it's late and your mama don't know

670	44841	41	Da-da-da-da
670	44842	42	
670	44843	43	[Bridge]
670	44844	44	I've heard every album, listened to the radio
670	44845	45	Waited for somethin' to come along
670	44846	46	That was as good as our song
670	44847	47	
670	44848	48	[Chorus]
670	44849	49	'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
670	44850	50	Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
670	44851	51	When we're on the phone and he talks real slow

670	44863	63	I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
670	44864	64	In the front seat of his car
670	44865	65	I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
670	44866	66	And I wrote down our song3
671	44631	1	[Verse 1]
671	44632	2	Friday night beneath the stars
671	44633	3	In a field behind your yard
671	44634	4	You and I are painting pictures in the sky
671	44635	5	And sometimes, we don't say a thing
671	44636	6	Just listen to the crickets sing
671	44637	7	Everything I need is right here by my side
671	44638	8	
671	44639	9	[Pre-Chorus]
671	44640	10	And I know everything about you
671	44641	11	I don't wanna live without you
671	44642	12	[Chorus]
671	44643	13	I'm only up when you're not down
671	44644	14	Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
671	44645	15	It's like no matter what I do
671	44646	16	Well, you drive me crazy half the time
671	44647	17	The other half, I'm only tryin' to
671	44648	18	Let you know that what I feel is true
671	44649	19	And I'm only me when I'm with you
671	44650	20	
671	44651	21	[Verse 2]
671	44652	22	Just a small-town boy and girl
671	44653	23	Livin' in a crazy world
671	44654	24	Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
671	44655	25	And I don't try to hide my tears
671	44656	26	My secrets or my deepest fears
671	44657	27	Through it all, nobody gets me like you do
671	44658	28	
671	44659	29	[Pre-Chorus]
671	44660	30	And you know everything about me
671	44661	31	You say that you can't live without me

671	44669	39	Let you know that what I feel is true
671	44670	40	And I'm only me when I'm with you
671	44671	41	[Bridge]
671	44672	42	When I'm with anybody else
671	44673	43	It's so hard to be myself
671	44674	44	And only you can tell
671	44675	45	
671	44676	46	[Chorus]
671	44677	47	That I'm only up when you're not down
671	44678	48	Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
671	44679	49	It's like no matter what I do

671	44689	59	Uh-huh-huh, yeah
672	44690	1	[Verse 1]
672	44691	2	She can't see the way your eyes
672	44692	3	Light up when you smile
672	44693	4	She'll never notice how you stop and stare
672	44694	5	Whenever she walks by
672	44695	6	
672	44696	7	[Pre-Chorus]
672	44697	8	And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
672	44698	9	But you are everything to me
672	44699	10	
672	44700	11	[Chorus]
672	44701	12	And I just wanna show you
672	44702	13	She don't even know you
672	44703	14	She's never gonna love you like I want to
672	44704	15	And you just see right through me
672	44705	16	But if you only knew me
672	44706	17	We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
672	44707	18	Instead of just invisible

672	44709	20	Oh, yeah, oh
672	44710	21	
672	44711	22	[Verse 2]
672	44712	23	There's a fire inside of you
672	44713	24	That can't help but shine through
672	44714	25	She's never gonna see the light
672	44715	26	No matter what you do
672	44716	27	
672	44717	28	[Pre-Chorus]
672	44718	29	And all I think about is how to make you think of me
672	44719	30	And everything that we could be
672	44720	31	
672	44721	32	[Chorus]
672	44722	33	And I just wanna show you
672	44723	34	She don't even know you
672	44724	35	She's never gonna love you like I want to
672	44725	36	And you just see right through me
672	44726	37	But if you only knew me
672	44727	38	We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
672	44728	39	Instead of just invisible
672	44729	40	
672	44730	41	[Bridge]
672	44731	42	Like shadows in a faded light
672	44732	43	Oh, we're invisible
672	44733	44	I just wanna open your eyes
672	44734	45	And make you realize
672	44735	46	[Chorus]
672	44736	47	I just wanna show you
672	44737	48	She don't even know you
672	44738	49	Baby, let me love you, let me want you
672	44739	50	You just see right through me
672	44740	51	But if you only knew me
672	44741	52	We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
672	44742	53	Instead of just invisible
672	44743	54	
672	44744	55	[Post-Chorus]
672	44745	56	Oh, yeah
672	44746	57	
672	44747	58	[Outro]
672	44748	59	She can't see the way your eyes
672	44749	60	Light up when you smile
673	44502	1	[Chorus]
673	44503	2	Why would you wanna break
673	44504	3	A perfectly good heart?
673	44505	4	Why would you wanna take
673	44506	5	Our love and tear it all apart now?
673	44507	6	Why would you wanna make
673	44508	7	The very first scar?
673	44509	8	Why would you wanna break
673	44510	9	A perfectly good heart?
673	44511	10	
673	44512	11	[Verse]
673	44513	12	Maybe I should've seen the signs
673	44514	13	Should've read the writing on the wall
673	44515	14	And realized by the distance in your eyes
673	44516	15	That I would be the one to fall
673	44517	16	[Pre-Chorus]
673	44518	17	No matter what you say
673	44519	18	I still can't believe that you would walk away
673	44520	19	It don't make sense to me, but
673	44521	20	
673	44522	21	[Chorus]
673	44523	22	Why would you wanna break
673	44524	23	A perfectly good heart?
673	44525	24	Why would you wanna take
673	44526	25	Our love and tear it all apart now?
673	44527	26	Why would you wanna make
673	44528	27	The very first scar?
673	44529	28	Why would you wanna break
673	44530	29	A perfectly good heart?
673	44531	30	
673	44532	31	[Bridge]
673	44533	32	It's not unbroken anymore (It's not unbroken anymore)
673	44534	33	How do I get it back the way it was before?
673	44535	34	
673	44536	35	[Chorus]
673	44537	36	Why would you wanna break
673	44538	37	A perfectly good heart?
673	44539	38	Why would you wanna take
673	44540	39	Our love and tear it all apart now?
673	44541	40	Why would you wanna make
673	44542	41	The very first scar?
673	44543	42	Why would you wanna break—
673	44544	43	(Why) Would you wanna break it?
673	44545	44	[Chorus]
673	44546	45	Why would you wanna break
673	44547	46	A perfectly good heart?
673	44548	47	Why would you wanna take
673	44549	48	Our love and tear it all apart now?
673	44550	49	Why would you wanna make
673	44551	50	The very first scar?
673	44552	51	Why would you wanna break
673	44553	52	A perfectly good heart?
673	44554	53	
673	44555	54	[Post-Chorus]
673	44556	55	Mmm-hmm
674	45140	1	[Verse 1]
674	45141	2	Drew looks at me
674	45142	3	I fake a smile so he won't see
674	45143	4	That I want and I'm needing
674	45144	5	Everything that we should be
674	45145	6	
674	45146	7	[Pre-Chorus]
674	45147	8	I'll bet she's beautiful
674	45148	9	That girl he talks about
674	45149	10	And she's got everything that I have to live without
674	45150	11	[Verse 2]
674	45151	12	Drew talks to me
674	45152	13	I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
674	45153	14	That I can't even see
674	45154	15	Anyone when he's with me
674	45155	16	
674	45156	17	[Pre-Chorus]
674	45157	18	He says he's so in love
674	45158	19	He's finally got it right
674	45159	20	I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
674	45160	21	
674	45161	22	[Chorus]
674	45162	23	He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
674	45163	24	The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
674	45164	25	He's the song in the car I keep singing
674	45165	26	Don't know why I do
674	45166	27	
674	45167	28	[Verse 3]
674	45168	29	Drew walks by me
674	45169	30	Can he tell that I can't breathe?
674	45170	31	And there he goes, so perfectly
674	45171	32	The kind of flawless I wish I could be
674	45172	33	
674	45173	34	[Pre-Chorus]
674	45174	35	She'd better hold him tight
674	45175	36	Give him all her love
674	45176	37	Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
674	45177	38	[Chorus]
674	45178	39	He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
674	45179	40	The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
674	45180	41	He's the song in the car I keep singing
674	45181	42	Don't know why I do
674	45182	43	
674	45183	44	[Bridge]
674	45184	45	So I drive home alone
674	45185	46	As I turn off the light
674	45186	47	I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
674	45187	48	
674	45188	49	[Chorus]
674	45189	50	'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
674	45190	51	The only one who’s got enough for me to break my heart
674	45191	52	He's the song in the car I keep singing
674	45192	53	Don't know why I do (Why I do)
674	45193	54	He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
674	45194	55	And he's all that I need to fall into
674	45195	56	
674	45196	57	[Outro]
674	45197	58	Drew looks at me

698	47626	2	I was supposed to be sent away
698	47627	3	But they forgot to come and get me
698	47628	4	I was a functioning alcoholic
698	47629	5	'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
698	47630	6	All of this to say I hope you're okay
698	47631	7	But you're the reason
698	47632	8	And no one here's to blame
698	47633	9	But what about your quiet treason?
698	47634	10	
698	47635	11	[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
698	47636	12	And for a fortnight there, we were forever
698	47637	13	Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
698	47638	14	Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
698	47639	15	Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
698	47640	16	
698	47641	17	[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone, Post Malone]
698	47642	18	All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February
698	47643	19	I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary
698	47644	20	And I love you, it's ruining my life
698	47645	21	I love you, it's ruining my life
698	47646	22	I touched you for only a fortnight
698	47647	23	I touched you, but I touched you
698	47648	24	
698	47649	25	[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone]

698	47653	29	Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
698	47654	30	And for a fortnight there, we were together
698	47655	31	Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
698	47656	32	Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors
698	47657	33	My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him
698	47658	34	[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Post Malone, Taylor Swift & Post Malone]
698	47659	35	I love you, it's ruining my life

698	47670	46	'Nother fortnight lost in America
698	47671	47	Move to Florida, buy the car you want
698	47672	48	But it won't start up 'til you touch, touch, touch me

699	48188	1	[Verse 1]
699	48189	2	You left your typewriter at my apartment
699	48190	3	Straight from the tortured poets department
699	48191	4	I think some things I never say
699	48192	5	Like, "Who uses typewriters anyway?"
699	48193	6	But you're in self-sabotage mode
699	48194	7	Throwing spikes down on the road
699	48195	8	But I've seen this episode and still loved the show
699	48196	9	Who else decodes you?
699	48197	10	
699	48198	11	[Chorus]
699	48199	12	And who's gonna hold you like me?
699	48200	13	And who's gonna know you, if not me?
699	48201	14	I laughed in your face and said
699	48202	15	"You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
699	48203	16	This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we'rе modern idiots"
699	48204	17	And who's gonna hold you like me?

699	48210	23	
699	48211	24	[Verse 2]
699	48212	25	You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate
699	48213	26	We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist
699	48214	27	I scratch your head, you fall asleep
699	48215	28	Like a tattooed golden retriever
699	48216	29	But you awaken with dread
699	48217	30	Pounding nails in your head
699	48218	31	But I've read this one where you come undone
699	48219	32	I chose this cyclone with you
699	48220	33	[Chorus]
699	48221	34	And who's gonna hold you like me?
699	48222	35	(Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)

699	48238	51	[Bridge]
699	48239	52	Sometimes, I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me
699	48240	53	But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave
699	48241	54	And I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen
699	48242	55	Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be
699	48243	56	'Cause we're crazy
699	48244	57	So tell me, who else is gonna know me?
699	48245	58	At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger
699	48246	59	And put it on the one people put wedding rings on
699	48247	60	And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding
699	48248	61	[Chorus]
699	48249	62	Who's gonna hold you? (Who?)
699	48250	63	Me
699	48251	64	Who's gonna know you? (Who?)
699	48252	65	Me
699	48253	66	And you're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
699	48254	67	This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're two idiots
699	48255	68	Who's gonna hold you?

700	47956	1	[Verse 1]
700	47957	2	Oh, here we go again
700	47958	3	The voices in his head
700	47959	4	Called the rain to end our days of wild
700	47960	5	The sickest army doll
700	47961	6	Purchased at the mall
700	47962	7	Rivulets descend my plastic smile
700	47963	8	
700	47964	9	[Pre-Chorus]
700	47965	10	But you should've seen him when he first got me
700	47966	11	
700	47967	12	[Chorus]
700	47968	13	My boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
700	47969	14	I'm queen of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh
700	47970	15	'Cause it fit too right, puzzle pieces in the dead of night
700	47971	16	I should've known it was a matter of time, oh, oh
700	47972	17	My boy only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh
700	47973	18	
700	47974	19	[Verse 2]
700	47975	20	There was a litany of reasons why
700	47976	21	We could've playеd for keeps this time
700	47977	22	I know I'm just repeating mysеlf
700	47978	23	Put me back on my shelf
700	47979	24	But first, pull the string
700	47980	25	And I'll tell you that he runs
700	47981	26	Because he loves me (He loves me)
700	47982	27	[Pre-Chorus]
700	47983	28	'Cause you should've seen him when he first saw me
700	47984	29	
700	47985	30	[Chorus]
700	47986	31	My boy (My boy), only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
700	47987	32	I'm queen (I'm queen), of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh
700	47988	33	'Cause I knew too much, there was danger in the heat of my touch
700	47989	34	He saw forever, so he smashed it up, oh, oh
700	47990	35	My boy (My boy), only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh
700	47991	36	
700	47992	37	[Bridge]
700	47993	38	Once I fix me
700	47994	39	He's gonna miss me
700	47995	40	Once I fix me
700	47996	41	He's gonna miss me
700	47997	42	
700	47998	43	[Outro]
700	47999	44	Just say when, I'd play again
700	48000	45	He was my best friend down at the sandlot
700	48001	46	I felt more when we played pretend
700	48002	47	Than with all the Kens
700	48003	48	'Cause he took me out of my box
700	48004	49	Stole my tortured heart
700	48005	50	Left all these broken parts
700	48006	51	Told me I'm better off
700	48007	52	But I'm not
700	48008	53	I'm not, I'm not
701	47465	1	[Verse 1]
701	47466	2	Did you really beam me up
701	47467	3	In a cloud of sparkling dust
701	47468	4	Just to do experiments on?
701	47469	5	Tell me I was the chosen one
701	47470	6	Showed me that this world is bigger than us
701	47471	7	Then sent me back where I came from
701	47472	8	
701	47473	9	[Pre-Chorus]
701	47474	10	For a moment, I knew cosmic love
701	47475	11	
701	47476	12	[Chorus]
701	47477	13	Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym
701	47478	14	Everything comes out teenage petulance
701	47479	15	"Fuck it if I can't have him"
701	47480	16	"I might just die, it would make no difference"
701	47481	17	Down bad, wakin' up in blood
701	47482	18	Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
701	47483	19	Fuck it if I can't have us
701	47484	20	I might just not get up, I might stay
701	47485	21	
701	47486	22	[Post-Chorus]
701	47487	23	Down bad
701	47488	24	Fuck it if I can't have him
701	47489	25	Down bad
701	47490	26	Fuck it if I can't have him
701	47491	27	[Verse 2]
701	47492	28	Did you take all my old clothes
701	47493	29	Just to leave me here, naked and alone
701	47494	30	In a field in my same old town
701	47495	31	That somehow seems so hollow now?
701	47496	32	They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about
701	47497	33	The existence of you
701	47498	34	
701	47499	35	[Pre-Chorus]
701	47500	36	For a moment, I was heavenstruck
701	47501	37	
701	47502	38	[Chorus]
701	47503	39	Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
701	47504	40	Everything comes out teenage petulance
701	47505	41	"Fuck it if I can't have him" (Fuck it if I can't have him)
701	47506	42	"I might just die, it would make no difference"
701	47507	43	Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
701	47508	44	Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
701	47509	45	Fuck it if I can't have us
701	47510	46	I might just not get up, I might stay
701	47511	47	
701	47512	48	[Post-Chorus]
701	47513	49	Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
701	47514	50	Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad)
701	47515	51	Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
701	47516	52	Fuck it if I can't have him
701	47517	53	[Bridge]
701	47518	54	I loved your hostile takeovers
701	47519	55	Encounters closer and closer
701	47520	56	All your indecent exposures
701	47521	57	How dare you say that it's—
701	47522	58	I'll build you a fort on some planet
701	47523	59	Where they can all understand it
701	47524	60	How dare you think it's romantic
701	47525	61	Leaving me safe and stranded
701	47526	62	'Cause fuck it, I was in love
701	47527	63	So fuck you if I can't have us
701	47528	64	'Cause fuck it, I was in love
701	47529	65	
701	47530	66	[Chorus]
701	47531	67	Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
701	47532	68	Everything comes out teenage petulance
701	47533	69	"Fuck it if I can't have him" (Can't have him)
701	47534	70	"I might just die, it would make no difference"
701	47535	71	Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
701	47536	72	Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
701	47537	73	Fuck it if I can't have us
701	47538	74	I might just not get up, I might stay
701	47539	75	
701	47540	76	[Post-Chorus]
701	47541	77	Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
701	47542	78	Fuck it if I can't have him (I'm down bad)
701	47543	79	Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
701	47544	80	Fuck it if I can't have him
701	47545	81	[Outro]
701	47546	82	Like I lost my twin
701	47547	83	Fuck it if I can't have him
701	47548	84	Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
701	47549	85	Fuck it if I can't have him
702	48009	1	[Intro]
702	48010	2	So (So) long (Long), London (London)
702	48011	3	So (So) long (Long), London (London)
702	48012	4	So (So) long (Long), London (London)
702	48013	5	[Verse 1]
702	48014	6	I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist
702	48015	7	I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift
702	48016	8	Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away
702	48017	9	My spine split from carrying us up the hill
702	48018	10	Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill
702	48019	11	I stopped tryna make him laugh, stopped tryna drill the safe
702	48020	12	
702	48021	13	[Chorus]
702	48022	14	Thinkin', "How much sad did you think I had
702	48023	15	Did you think I had in me?"
702	48024	16	Oh, the tragedy
702	48025	17	So long, London
702	48026	18	You'll find someone
702	48027	19	
702	48028	20	[Verse 2]
702	48029	21	I didn't opt in to be your odd man out
702	48030	22	I founded the club she's heard great things about
702	48031	23	I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath
702	48032	24	I stoppеd CPR, after all, it's no use
702	48033	25	The spirit was gonе, we would never come to
702	48034	26	And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free
702	48035	27	[Chorus]
702	48036	28	For so long, London
702	48037	29	Stitches undone
702	48038	30	Two graves, one gun
702	48039	31	I'll find someone
702	48040	32	
702	48041	33	[Bridge]
702	48042	34	And you say I abandoned the ship
702	48043	35	But I was going down with it
702	48044	36	My white-knuckle dying grip
702	48045	37	Holding tight to your quiet resentment
702	48046	38	And my friends said it isn't right to be scared
702	48047	39	Every day of a love affair
702	48048	40	Every breath feels like rarest air
702	48049	41	When you're not sure if he wants to be there
702	48050	42	
702	48051	43	[Chorus]
702	48052	44	So how much sad did you think I had
702	48053	45	Did you think I had in me?
702	48054	46	How much tragedy?
702	48055	47	Just how low did you
702	48056	48	Think I'd go 'fore I'd self-implode?
702	48057	49	'Fore I'd have to go be free?
702	48058	50	
702	48059	51	[Verse 3]
702	48060	52	You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?
702	48061	53	I died on the altar waitin' for the proof
702	48062	54	You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days
702	48063	55	And I'm just getting color back into my face
702	48064	56	I'm just mad as hell 'cause I loved this place for
702	48065	57	[Chorus]
702	48066	58	So (So) long (Long), London (London)
702	48067	59	Had (Had) a (A) good (Good) run (Run)
702	48068	60	A moment (Moment) of warm sun (Sun)
702	48069	61	But I'm (I'm) not (Not) the (The) one (One)
702	48070	62	So (So) long (Long), London (London)
702	48071	63	Stitches (Stitches) undone (Undone)
702	48072	64	Two (Two) graves (Graves) one gun (Gun)
702	48073	65	You'll (You'll) find (Find) someone
703	47309	1	[Verse 1]
703	47310	2	I forget how the West was won
703	47311	3	I forget if this was ever fun
703	47312	4	I just learned these people only raise you
703	47313	5	To cage you
703	47314	6	Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
703	47315	7	Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, "What a mess"
703	47316	8	I just learned these people try and save you
703	47317	9	'Cause they hate you
703	47318	10	
703	47319	11	[Pre-Chorus]
703	47320	12	Too high a horse
703	47321	13	For a simple girl
703	47322	14	To rise above it
703	47323	15	They slammed the door
703	47324	16	On my whole world
703	47325	17	The one thing I wanted
703	47326	18	
703	47327	19	[Chorus]
703	47328	20	Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
703	47329	21	Scrеamin', "But, Daddy, I love him"
703	47330	22	I'm havin' his baby
703	47331	23	No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
703	47332	24	I'm tellin' him to floor it through thе fences
703	47333	25	No, I'm not coming to my senses
703	47334	26	I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want
703	47335	27	[Verse 2]
703	47336	28	Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid
703	47337	29	Tendrils tucked into a woven braid
703	47338	30	Growin' up precocious sometimes means
703	47339	31	Not growin' up at all
703	47340	32	He was chaos, he was revelry
703	47341	33	Bedroom eyes like a remedy
703	47342	34	Soon enough, the elders had convened
703	47343	35	Down at the city hall
703	47344	36	
703	47345	37	[Pre-Chorus]
703	47346	38	"Stay away from her"
703	47347	39	The saboteurs
703	47348	40	Protested too much
703	47349	41	Lord knows the words
703	47350	42	We never heard
703	47351	43	Just screeching tires and true love
703	47352	44	
703	47353	45	[Chorus]
703	47354	46	And I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
703	47355	47	Screamin', "But, Daddy, I love him"
703	47356	48	I'm havin' his baby
703	47357	49	No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
703	47358	50	I'm tellin' him to floor it through the fences
703	47359	51	No, I'm not coming to my senses
703	47360	52	I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want
703	47361	53	[Post-Chorus]
703	47362	54	I'll tell you something right now
703	47363	55	I'd rather burn my whole life down
703	47364	56	Than listen to one more second of all this bitchin' and moanin'
703	47365	57	I'll tell you something 'bout my good name
703	47366	58	It's mine alone to disgrace
703	47367	59	I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing
703	47368	60	
703	47369	61	[Bridge]
703	47370	62	God save the most judgmental creeps
703	47371	63	Who say they want what's best for me
703	47372	64	Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
703	47373	65	Thinkin' it can change the beat
703	47374	66	Of my heart when he touches me
703	47375	67	And counteract the chemistry
703	47376	68	And undo the destiny
703	47377	69	You ain't gotta pray for me
703	47378	70	Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
703	47379	71	If all you want is gray for me
703	47380	72	Then it's just white noise, and it's just my choice
703	47381	73	
703	47382	74	[Verse 3]
703	47383	75	There's a lot of people in town that I
703	47384	76	Bestow upon my fakest smiles
703	47385	77	Scandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer
703	47386	78	We came back when the heat died down
703	47387	79	Went to my parents and they came around
703	47388	80	All the wine moms are still holdin' out, but fuck 'em, it's over
703	47389	81	[Chorus]
703	47390	82	Now I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun and
703	47391	83	Even my daddy just loves him
703	47392	84	I'm his lady
703	47393	85	And, oh my God, you should see your faces
703	47394	86	Time, doesn't it give some perspective?
703	47395	87	And, no, you can't come to the wedding
703	47396	88	I know it's crazy, but he's the one I want
703	47397	89	
703	47398	90	[Post-Chorus]
703	47399	91	I'll tell you something right now
703	47400	92	You ain't gotta pray for me
703	47401	93	Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
703	47402	94	(He was chaos, he was revelry)
703	47403	95	If all you want is gray for me
703	47404	96	Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice
703	47405	97	
703	47406	98	[Outro]
703	47407	99	Screamin', "But, Daddy, I love him"
703	47408	100	I'm having his baby
703	47409	101	No, I'm not
703	47410	102	But you should see your faces
703	47411	103	But, oh my God, you should see your faces
703	47412	104	(He was chaos, he was revelry)
703	47413	105	(He was chaos, he was revelry)1
704	47677	1	[Intro]
704	47678	2	Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
704	47679	3	Fresh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
704	47680	4	(Fresh out the slammer, oh)
704	47681	5	
704	47682	6	[Verse 1]
704	47683	7	Another summer takin' cover, rolling thunder
704	47684	8	He don't understand me
704	47685	9	Splintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter
704	47686	10	He was with her in dreams
704	47687	11	
704	47688	12	[Pre-Chorus]
704	47689	13	Gray and blue and fights and tunnels
704	47690	14	Handcuffed to the spell I was under
704	47691	15	For just one hour of sunshine
704	47692	16	Years of labor, locks, and ceilings
704	47693	17	In the shade of how he was feeling
704	47694	18	But it's gonna be alright, I did my time
704	47695	19	
704	47696	20	[Chorus]
704	47697	21	Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
704	47698	22	Frеsh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
704	47699	23	(Frеsh out the slammer, oh)
704	47700	24	
704	47701	25	[Verse 2]
704	47702	26	Camera flashes, welcome bashes, get the matches
704	47703	27	Toss the ashes off the ledge
704	47704	28	As I said in my letters, now that I know better
704	47705	29	I will never lose my baby again
704	47706	30	[Pre-Chorus]
704	47707	31	My friends tried, but I wouldn't hear it
704	47708	32	Watch me daily disappearing
704	47709	33	For just one glimpse of his smile
704	47710	34	All those nights, he kept me goin'
704	47711	35	Swirled you into all of my poems
704	47712	36	Now we're at the starting line, I did my time
704	47713	37	
704	47714	38	[Chorus]
704	47715	39	Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin'
704	47716	40	
704	47717	41	[Bridge]
704	47718	42	To the house where you still wait up and that porch light gleams (Gleams)
704	47719	43	To the one who says I'm the girl of his American dreams
704	47720	44	And no matter what I've done, it wouldn't matter anyway
704	47721	45	Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up now that I know what's at stake here
704	47722	46	At the park where we used to sit on children's swings
704	47723	47	Wearing imaginary rings
704	47724	48	
704	47725	49	[Outro]
704	47726	50	But it's gonna be alright, I did my time
705	47550	1	[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
705	47551	2	You can beat the heat if you beat the charges too
705	47552	3	They said I was a cheat, I guess it must be true
705	47553	4	And my friends all smell like weed or little babies
705	47554	5	And this city reeks of driving myself crazy
705	47555	6	
705	47556	7	[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
705	47557	8	Little did you know your home's really only
705	47558	9	A town you're just a guest in
705	47559	10	So you work your life away just to pay
705	47560	11	For a time-share down in Destin
705	47561	12	
705	47562	13	[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Florence Welch, Taylor Swift]
705	47563	14	Florida
705	47564	15	Is one hell of a drug
705	47565	16	Florida
705	47566	17	Can I use you up?
705	47567	18	
705	47568	19	[Verse 2: Florence Welch, Taylor Swift & Florence Welch]
705	47569	20	The hurricane with my name when it came
705	47570	21	I got drunk and I dared it to wash me away
705	47571	22	Barricaded in the bathroom with a bottle of wine
705	47572	23	Well, me and my ghosts, wе had a hell of a time
705	47573	24	Yes, I'm hauntеd, but I'm feeling just fine
705	47574	25	All my girls got their lace and their crimes
705	47575	26	And your cheating husband disappeared, well
705	47576	27	No one asks any questions here
705	47577	28	So I did my best to lay to rest
705	47578	29	All of the bodies that have ever been on my body
705	47579	30	And in my mind, they sink into the swamp
705	47580	31	Is that a bad thing to say in a song?
705	47581	32	[Pre-Chorus: Florence Welch]
705	47582	33	Little did you know your home's really only
705	47583	34	The town you'll get arrested
705	47584	35	So you pack your life away just to wait out
705	47585	36	The shitstorm back in Texas
705	47586	37	
705	47587	38	[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Florence Welch, Taylor Swift]
705	47588	39	Florida
705	47589	40	Is one hell of a drug
705	47590	41	Florida
705	47591	42	Can I use you up?
705	47592	43	
705	47593	44	[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Florence Welch, Taylor Swift & Florence Welch]
705	47594	45	I need to forget, so take me to Florida
705	47595	46	I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida
705	47596	47	Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable
705	47597	48	At least the dolls are beautiful, fuck me up, Florida
705	47598	49	I need to forget, so take me to Florida
705	47599	50	I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida
705	47600	51	Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable
705	47601	52	What a crash, what a rush, fuck me up, Florida
705	47602	53	It's one hell of a drug
705	47603	54	It's one hell of a drug
705	47604	55	Love left me like this and I don't want to exist
705	47605	56	So take me to Florida
705	47606	57	[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Florence Welch, Florence Welch]
705	47607	58	Little did you know your home's really only
705	47608	59	A town you're just a guest in (Florida)
705	47609	60	So you work your life away just to pay
705	47610	61	For a time-share down in Destin (Take me to Florida)
705	47611	62	Little did you know your home's really only
705	47612	63	The town you'll get arrested (Florida)
705	47613	64	So you pack your life away just to wait out
705	47614	65	The shitstorm back in Texas
705	47615	66	
705	47616	67	[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Florence Welch, Taylor Swift]
705	47617	68	Florida
705	47618	69	Is one hell of a drug
705	47619	70	(Take me to) Florida
705	47620	71	Can I use you up?
705	47621	72	Florida
705	47622	73	Is one hell of a drug
705	47623	74	Florida
705	47624	75	Go on, fuck me up
706	47727	1	[Verse 1]
706	47728	2	Drownin' in the Blue Nile
706	47729	3	He sent me "Downtown Lights"
706	47730	4	I hadn't heard it in a while
706	47731	5	My boredom's bone-deep
706	47732	6	This cage was once just fine
706	47733	7	Am I allowed to cry?
706	47734	8	I dream of crackin' locks
706	47735	9	Throwin' my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks
706	47736	10	Crashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox
706	47737	11	I'm seeing visions
706	47738	12	Am I bad or mad or wise?
706	47739	13	
706	47740	14	[Chorus]
706	47741	15	What if he's written "mine" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
706	47742	16	One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
706	47743	17	Oh, what a way to die
706	47744	18	I keep recalling things we never did
706	47745	19	Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
706	47746	20	Without ever touchin' his skin
706	47747	21	How can I be guilty as sin?
706	47748	22	
706	47749	23	[Verse 2]
706	47750	24	I keep these longings lockеd
706	47751	25	In lowercase, inside a vault
706	47752	26	Somеone told me, "There's no such thing as bad thoughts
706	47753	27	Only your actions talk"
706	47754	28	These fatal fantasies
706	47755	29	Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me
706	47756	30	We've already done it in my head
706	47757	31	If it's make-believe
706	47758	32	Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?
706	47759	33	[Chorus]
706	47760	34	What if he's written "mine" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
706	47761	35	One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
706	47762	36	Oh, what a way to die
706	47763	37	My bed sheets are ablaze
706	47764	38	I've screamed his name
706	47765	39	Buildin' up like waves crashin' over my grave
706	47766	40	Without ever touchin' his skin
706	47767	41	How can I be guilty as sin?
706	47768	42	
706	47769	43	[Bridge]
706	47770	44	What if I roll the stone away?
706	47771	45	They're gonna crucify me anyway
706	47772	46	What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?
706	47773	47	If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me
706	47774	48	They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly
706	47775	49	I choose you and me religiously
706	47776	50	
706	47777	51	[Chorus]
706	47778	52	What if he's written "mine" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
706	47779	53	One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
706	47780	54	Oh, what a way to die
706	47781	55	I keep recalling things we never did
706	47782	56	Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
706	47783	57	Without ever touchin' his skin
706	47784	58	How can I be guilty as sin?
706	47785	59	[Outro]
706	47786	60	He sent me "Downtown Lights"
706	47787	61	I hadn't heard it in a while
706	47788	62	Am I allowed to cry?
707	48271	1	[Verse 1]
707	48272	2	The who's who of "Who's that?" is poised for the attack
707	48273	3	But my bare hands paved their paths
707	48274	4	You don't get to tell me about "sad"
707	48275	5	
707	48276	6	[Pre-Chorus]
707	48277	7	If you wanted me dead, you should've just said
707	48278	8	Nothing makes me feel more alive
707	48279	9	
707	48280	10	[Chorus]
707	48281	11	So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
707	48282	12	Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
707	48283	13	"Who's afraid of little old me?"
707	48284	14	You should be
707	48285	15	
707	48286	16	[Verse 2]
707	48287	17	The scandal was contained
707	48288	18	The bullet had just grazed
707	48289	19	At all costs, keep your good name
707	48290	20	You don't get to tell me you feel bad
707	48291	21	
707	48292	22	[Pre-Chorus]
707	48293	23	Is it a wonder I broke? Let's hear one morе joke
707	48294	24	Then we could all just laugh until I cry
707	48295	25	
707	48296	26	[Chorus]
707	48297	27	So I lеap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
707	48298	28	Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
707	48299	29	"Who's afraid of little old me?"
707	48300	30	I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean
707	48301	31	"Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth"
707	48302	32	Who's afraid of little old me?
707	48303	33	Well, you should be
707	48304	34	[Post-Chorus]
707	48305	35	(You should be) You should be
707	48306	36	(You should be) You should be
707	48307	37	You should be (You should be)
707	48308	38	You should be (You should be)
707	48309	39	You should be
707	48310	40	
707	48311	41	[Bridge]
707	48312	42	So tell me everything is not about me
707	48313	43	But what if it is?
707	48314	44	Then say they didn't do it to hurt me
707	48315	45	But what if they did?
707	48316	46	I wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me
707	48317	47	You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me
707	48318	48	So all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs
707	48319	49	I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?
707	48320	50	That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn
707	48321	51	That I'm fearsome and I'm wretched and I'm wrong
707	48322	52	Put narcotics into all of my songs
707	48323	53	And that's why you're still singin' along
707	48324	54	
707	48325	55	[Chorus]
707	48326	56	So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
707	48327	57	Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
707	48328	58	"Who's afraid of little old me?"
707	48329	59	I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean
707	48330	60	"Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth"
707	48331	61	Who's afraid of little old me?
707	48332	62	Well, you should be
707	48333	63	[Post-Chorus]
707	48334	64	(You should be) You should be
707	48335	65	(You should be) You should be
707	48336	66	'Cause you lured me (You should be)
707	48337	67	And you hurt me (You should be)
707	48338	68	And you taught me
707	48339	69	
707	48340	70	[Outro]
707	48341	71	You caged me and then you called me crazy
707	48342	72	I am what I am 'cause you trained me
707	48343	73	So who's afraid of me?
707	48344	74	Who's afraid of little old me?
707	48345	75	Who's afraid of little old me?
708	47851	1	[Verse 1]
708	47852	2	The smoke cloud billows out his mouth
708	47853	3	Like a freight train through a small town
708	47854	4	The jokes that he told across the bar
708	47855	5	Were revolting and far too loud
708	47856	6	
708	47857	7	[Chorus]
708	47858	8	They shake their heads sayin', "God, help her"
708	47859	9	When I tell 'em he's my man
708	47860	10	But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger
708	47861	11	I can fix him, no, really, I can
708	47862	12	And only I can
708	47863	13	
708	47864	14	[Verse 2]
708	47865	15	The dopamine races through his brain
708	47866	16	On a six-lane Texas highway
708	47867	17	His hand so calloused from his pistol
708	47868	18	Softly traces hearts on my face
708	47869	19	And I could see it from a mile away
708	47870	20	A perfect case for my certain skill set
708	47871	21	He had a halo of the highest gradе
708	47872	22	He just hadn't met me yеt
708	47873	23	
708	47874	24	[Chorus]
708	47875	25	They shake their heads sayin', "God, help her"
708	47876	26	When I tell 'em he's my man
708	47877	27	But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger
708	47878	28	I can fix him, no, really, I can
708	47879	29	And only I can
708	47880	30	[Bridge]
708	47881	31	Good boy, that's right, come close
708	47882	32	I'll show you Heaven if you'll be an angel, all night
708	47883	33	Trust me, I can handle me a dangerous man
708	47884	34	No, really, I can
708	47885	35	
708	47886	36	[Chorus]
708	47887	37	They shook their heads sayin', "God, help her"
708	47888	38	When I told 'em he's my man (I told 'em he's my man)
708	47889	39	But your good Lord didn't need to lift a finger
708	47890	40	I can fix him, no, really, I can (No, really, I can)
708	47891	41	Woah, maybe I can't
709	47892	1	[Verse 1]
709	47893	2	Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames
709	47894	3	If we know the steps anyway?
709	47895	4	We embroidered the memories of the time I was away
709	47896	5	Stitching, "We were just kids, babe"
709	47897	6	I said, "I don't mind, it takes time"
709	47898	7	I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed
709	47899	8	I felt aglow like this
709	47900	9	Never before and never since
709	47901	10	
709	47902	11	[Chorus]
709	47903	12	If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
709	47904	13	You and I go from one kiss to getting married
709	47905	14	Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery
709	47906	15	Never quite buried
709	47907	16	In your suit and tie, in the nick of time
709	47908	17	You low-down boy, you stand-up guy
709	47909	18	You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life
709	47910	19	You said I'm the love of your life
709	47911	20	About a million times
709	47912	21	
709	47913	22	[Verse 2]
709	47914	23	Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate
709	47915	24	And told me I reformed you?
709	47916	25	When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
709	47917	26	Well, you took me to hell too
709	47918	27	And all at once, the ink bleeds
709	47919	28	A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme
709	47920	29	But I've felt a hole like this
709	47921	30	Never before and ever since
709	47922	31	[Chorus]
709	47923	32	If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
709	47924	33	What we thought was for all time was momentary
709	47925	34	Still alive, killing time at the cemetery
709	47926	35	Never quite buried
709	47927	36	You cinephile in black and white
709	47928	37	All those plot twists and dynamite
709	47929	38	Mr. Steal Your Girl, then make her cry
709	47930	39	You said I'm the love of your life
709	47931	40	
709	47932	41	[Bridge]
709	47933	42	You shit-talked me under the table
709	47934	43	Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles
709	47935	44	I wish I could un-recall
709	47936	45	How we almost had it all
709	47937	46	Dancing phantoms on the terrace
709	47938	47	Are they second-hand embarrassed
709	47939	48	That I can't get out of bed
709	47940	49	'Cause something counterfeit's dead?
709	47941	50	It was legendary
709	47942	51	It was momentary
709	47943	52	It was unnecessary
709	47944	53	Should've let it stay buried
709	47945	54	
709	47946	55	[Chorus]
709	47947	56	Oh, what a valiant roar
709	47948	57	What a bland goodbye
709	47949	58	The coward claimed he was a lion
709	47950	59	I'm combing through the braids of lies
709	47951	60	"I'll never leave," "Never mind"
709	47952	61	Our field of dreams engulfed in fire
709	47953	62	Your arson's match, your somber eyes
709	47954	63	And I'll still see it until I die
709	47955	64	You're the loss of my life
710	47789	1	[Verse 1]
710	47790	2	I can read your mind
710	47791	3	"She's having the time of her life"
710	47792	4	There in her glittering prime
710	47793	5	The lights refract sequin stars off her silhouette every night
710	47794	6	I can show you lies
710	47795	7	(One, two, three, four)
710	47796	8	
710	47797	9	[Pre-Chorus]
710	47798	10	'Cause I'm a real tough kid
710	47799	11	I can handle my shit
710	47800	12	They said, "Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it" and I did
710	47801	13	Lights, camera, bitch, smile
710	47802	14	Even when you wanna die
710	47803	15	He said he'd love me all his life
710	47804	16	But that life was too short
710	47805	17	Breaking down, I hit the floor
710	47806	18	All the piеces of me shatterеd as the crowd was chanting, "More"
710	47807	19	I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
710	47808	20	I was hittin' my marks
710	47809	21	'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
710	47810	22	(One, two, three, four)
710	47811	23	[Chorus]
710	47812	24	I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
710	47813	25	I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me like the plague
710	47814	26	I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
710	47815	27	You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
710	47816	28	[Verse 2]
710	47817	29	I can hold my breath
710	47818	30	I've been doin' it since he left
710	47819	31	I keep finding his things in drawers
710	47820	32	Crucial evidence I didn't imagine the whole thing
710	47821	33	I'm sure I can pass this test
710	47822	34	(One, two, three, four)
710	47823	35	
710	47824	36	[Pre-Chorus]
710	47825	37	'Cause I'm a real tough kid
710	47826	38	I can handle my shit
710	47827	39	They said, "Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it" and I did
710	47828	40	Lights, camera, bitch, smile
710	47829	41	In stilettos for miles
710	47830	42	He said he'd love me for all time
710	47831	43	But that time was quite short
710	47832	44	Breaking down, I hit the floor
710	47833	45	All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, "More"
710	47834	46	I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
710	47835	47	I was hittin' my marks
710	47836	48	'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
710	47837	49	(One, two, three, four)
710	47838	50	
710	47839	51	[Chorus]
710	47840	52	I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
710	47841	53	I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me (He avoids me), like the plague
710	47842	54	I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
710	47843	55	You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
710	47844	56	[Outro]
710	47845	57	You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
710	47846	58	You know you're good
710	47847	59	And I'm good
710	47848	60	'Cause I'm miserable (Haha)
710	47849	61	And nobody even knows
710	47850	62	Ah, try and come for my job
711	48137	1	[Verse 1]
711	48138	2	Was any of it true?
711	48139	3	Gazing at me starry-eyed
711	48140	4	In your Jehovah's Witness suit
711	48141	5	Who the fuck was that guy?
711	48142	6	You tried to buy some pills
711	48143	7	From a friend of friends of mine
711	48144	8	They just ghosted you
711	48145	9	Now you know what it feels like
711	48146	10	
711	48147	11	[Chorus]
711	48148	12	And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
711	48149	13	If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
711	48150	14	And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
711	48151	15	A message to the smallest man who ever lived?
711	48152	16	
711	48153	17	[Verse 2]
711	48154	18	You hung me on your wall
711	48155	19	Stabbed me with your push pins
711	48156	20	In public, showed me off
711	48157	21	Then sank in stoned oblivion
711	48158	22	'Cause once your queen had come
711	48159	23	You'd treat her likе an also-ran
711	48160	24	You didn't measure up
711	48161	25	In any measurе of a man
711	48162	26	[Chorus]
711	48163	27	And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
711	48164	28	If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
711	48165	29	And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
711	48166	30	A message to the smallest man who ever lived?
711	48167	31	
711	48168	32	[Bridge]
711	48169	33	Were you sent by someone who wanted me dead?
711	48170	34	Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?
711	48171	35	Were you writin' a book? Were you a sleeper cell spy?
711	48172	36	In fifty years, will all this be declassified?
711	48173	37	And you'll confess why you did it and I'll say, "Good riddance"
711	48174	38	'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden
711	48175	39	I would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside
711	48176	40	And you deserve prison, but you won't get time
711	48177	41	You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars
711	48178	42	You crashed my party and your rental car
711	48179	43	You said normal girls were boring
711	48180	44	But you were gone by the morning
711	48181	45	You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing
711	48182	46	
711	48183	47	[Outro]
711	48184	48	And in plain sight you hid
711	48185	49	But you are what you did
711	48186	50	And I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive
711	48187	51	The smallest man who ever lived
712	48074	1	[Verse 1]
712	48075	2	This happens once every few lifetimes
712	48076	3	These chemicals hit me like white wine
712	48077	4	What if I told you I'm back?
712	48078	5	The hospital was a drag
712	48079	6	Worst sleep that I ever had
712	48080	7	I circled you on a map
712	48081	8	I haven't come around in so long
712	48082	9	But I'm coming back so strong
712	48083	10	
712	48084	11	[Chorus]
712	48085	12	So when I touch down
712	48086	13	Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
712	48087	14	Ditch the clowns, get the crown
712	48088	15	Baby, I'm the one to beat
712	48089	16	'Cause the sign on your heart
712	48090	17	Said it's still reserved for me
712	48091	18	Honestly, who are we to fight thе alchemy?
712	48092	19	
712	48093	20	[Verse 2]
712	48094	21	Hey, you, what if I told you we'rе cool?
712	48095	22	That child's play back in school
712	48096	23	Is forgiven under my rule
712	48097	24	I haven't come around in so long
712	48098	25	But I'm making a comeback to where I belong
712	48099	26	[Chorus]
712	48100	27	So when I touch down
712	48101	28	Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
712	48102	29	Ditch the clowns, get the crown
712	48103	30	Baby, I'm the one to beat
712	48104	31	'Cause the sign on your heart
712	48105	32	Said it's still reserved for me
712	48106	33	Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?
712	48107	34	These blokes warm the benches
712	48108	35	We've been on a winning streak
712	48109	36	He jokes that it's heroin, but this time with an "E"
712	48110	37	'Cause the sign on your heart
712	48111	38	Said it's still reserved for me
712	48112	39	Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?
712	48113	40	
712	48114	41	[Bridge]
712	48115	42	Shirts off and your friends lift you up over their heads
712	48116	43	Beer stickin' to the floor, cheers chanted 'cause they said
712	48117	44	"There was no chance trying to be the greatest in the league"
712	48118	45	Where's the trophy? He just comes runnin' over to me
712	48119	46	
712	48120	47	[Chorus]
712	48121	48	Touchdown
712	48122	49	Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
712	48123	50	Ditch the clowns, get the crown
712	48124	51	Baby, I'm the one to beat
712	48125	52	'Cause the sign on your heart

712	48134	61	[Outro]
712	48135	62	This happens once every few lifetimes
712	48136	63	These chemicals hit me like white wine
713	47414	1	[Verse 1]
713	47415	2	"You look like Clara Bow
713	47416	3	In this light, remarkable
713	47417	4	All your life, did you know
713	47418	5	You'd be picked like a rose?"
713	47419	6	
713	47420	7	[Pre-Chorus]
713	47421	8	"I'm not trying to exaggerate
713	47422	9	But I think I might die if it happened
713	47423	10	Die if it happened to me
713	47424	11	No one in my small town
713	47425	12	Thought I'd see the lights of Manhattan"
713	47426	13	
713	47427	14	[Chorus]
713	47428	15	"This town is fake, but you're the real thing
713	47429	16	Breath of fresh air through smoke rings
713	47430	17	Take the glory, give everything
713	47431	18	Promise to be dazzling"
713	47432	19	[Verse 2]
713	47433	20	"You look like Stevie Nicks
713	47434	21	In '75, the hair and lips
713	47435	22	Crowd goes wild at her fingertips
713	47436	23	Half moonshine, a full еclipse"
713	47437	24	
713	47438	25	[Pre-Chorus]
713	47439	26	"I'm not trying to exaggeratе
713	47440	27	But I think I might die if I made it, die if I made it
713	47441	28	No one in my small town thought I'd meet these suits in L.A.
713	47442	29	They all wanna say..."
713	47443	30	[Chorus]
713	47444	31	"This town is fake, but you're the real thing
713	47445	32	Breath of fresh air through smoke rings
713	47446	33	Take the glory, give everything
713	47447	34	Promise to be dazzling
713	47448	35	The crown is stained, but you're the real queen
713	47449	36	Flesh and blood amongst war machines
713	47450	37	You're the new god we're worshipping
713	47451	38	Promise to be dazzling"
713	47452	39	
713	47453	40	[Bridge]
713	47454	41	Beauty is a beast that roars down on all fours
713	47455	42	Demanding more
713	47456	43	Only when your girlish glow flickers just so
713	47457	44	Do they let you know
713	47458	45	It's hell on earth to be heavenly
713	47459	46	Them's the breaks, they don't come gently
713	47460	47	[Outro]
713	47461	48	"You look like Taylor Swift
713	47462	49	In this light, we're lovin' it
713	47463	50	You've got edge, she never did
713	47464	51	The future's bright, dazzling"
748	53150	1	[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
748	53151	2	I was supposed to be sent away
748	53152	3	But they forgot to come and get me
748	53153	4	I was a functioning alcoholic
748	53154	5	'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
748	53155	6	All of this to say I hope you're okay
748	53156	7	But you're the reason
748	53157	8	And no one here's to blame
748	53158	9	But what about your quiet treason?
748	53159	10	
748	53160	11	[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
748	53161	12	And for a fortnight there, we were forever
748	53162	13	Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
748	53163	14	Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
748	53164	15	Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
748	53165	16	
748	53166	17	[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone, Post Malone]
748	53167	18	All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February
748	53168	19	I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary
748	53169	20	And I love you, it's ruining my life
748	53170	21	I love you, it's ruining my life
748	53171	22	I touched you for only a fortnight
748	53172	23	I touched you, but I touched you
748	53173	24	
748	53174	25	[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone]
748	53175	26	And for a fortnight there, we were forever
748	53176	27	Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
748	53177	28	Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
748	53178	29	Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
748	53179	30	And for a fortnight there, we were together
748	53180	31	Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
748	53181	32	Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors
748	53182	33	My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him
748	53183	34	[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Post Malone, Taylor Swift & Post Malone]
748	53184	35	I love you, it's ruining my life
748	53185	36	I love you, it's ruining my life
748	53186	37	I touched you for only a fortnight
748	53187	38	I touched you, I touched you

748	53189	40	I love you, it's ruining my life
748	53190	41	I touched you for only a fortnight
748	53191	42	I touched you, I touched you
748	53192	43	
748	53193	44	[Outro: Post Malone, Post Malone & Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift]
748	53194	45	Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up
748	53195	46	'Nother fortnight lost in America
748	53196	47	Move to Florida, buy the car you want
748	53197	48	But it won't start up 'til you touch, touch, touch me
748	53198	49	Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up
748	53199	50	'Nother fortnight lost in America
748	53200	51	Move to Florida, buy the car you want

749	54520	1	[Verse 1]
749	54521	2	You left your typewriter at my apartment
749	54522	3	Straight from the tortured poets department
749	54523	4	I think some things I never say
749	54524	5	Like, "Who uses typewriters anyway?"
749	54525	6	But you're in self-sabotage mode
749	54526	7	Throwing spikes down on the road
749	54527	8	But I've seen this episode and still loved the show
749	54528	9	Who else decodes you?
749	54529	10	
749	54530	11	[Chorus]
749	54531	12	And who's gonna hold you like me?
749	54532	13	And who's gonna know you, if not me?
749	54533	14	I laughed in your face and said
749	54534	15	"You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
749	54535	16	This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we'rе modern idiots"
749	54536	17	And who's gonna hold you like me?
749	54537	18	
749	54538	19	[Post-Chorus]
749	54539	20	Nobody

749	54542	23	
749	54543	24	[Verse 2]
749	54544	25	You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate
749	54545	26	We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist
749	54546	27	I scratch your head, you fall asleep
749	54547	28	Like a tattooed golden retriever
749	54548	29	But you awaken with dread
749	54549	30	Pounding nails in your head
749	54550	31	But I've read this one where you come undone
749	54551	32	I chose this cyclone with you
749	54552	33	[Chorus]
749	54553	34	And who's gonna hold you like me?
749	54554	35	(Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)

749	54570	51	[Bridge]
749	54571	52	Sometimes, I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me
749	54572	53	But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave
749	54573	54	And I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen
749	54574	55	Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be
749	54575	56	'Cause we're crazy
749	54576	57	So tell me, who else is gonna know me?
749	54577	58	At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger
749	54578	59	And put it on the one people put wedding rings on
749	54579	60	And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding
749	54580	61	[Chorus]
749	54581	62	Who's gonna hold you? (Who?)
749	54582	63	Me
749	54583	64	Who's gonna know you? (Who?)
749	54584	65	Me

749	54599	80	[Outro]
749	54600	81	You left your typewriter at my apartment
749	54601	82	Straight from the tortured poets department
749	54602	83	Who else decodes you?
750	53703	1	[Verse 1]
750	53704	2	Oh, here we go again
750	53705	3	The voices in his head
750	53706	4	Called the rain to end our days of wild
750	53707	5	The sickest army doll
750	53708	6	Purchased at the mall
750	53709	7	Rivulets descend my plastic smile
750	53710	8	
750	53711	9	[Pre-Chorus]
750	53712	10	But you should've seen him when he first got me
750	53713	11	
750	53714	12	[Chorus]
750	53715	13	My boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
750	53716	14	I'm queen of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh
750	53717	15	'Cause it fit too right, puzzle pieces in the dead of night
750	53718	16	I should've known it was a matter of time, oh, oh
750	53719	17	My boy only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh
750	53720	18	
750	53721	19	[Verse 2]
750	53722	20	There was a litany of reasons why
750	53723	21	We could've playеd for keeps this time
750	53724	22	I know I'm just repeating mysеlf
750	53725	23	Put me back on my shelf
750	53726	24	But first, pull the string
750	53727	25	And I'll tell you that he runs
750	53728	26	Because he loves me (He loves me)
750	53729	27	[Pre-Chorus]
750	53730	28	'Cause you should've seen him when he first saw me
750	53731	29	
750	53732	30	[Chorus]
750	53733	31	My boy (My boy), only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
750	53734	32	I'm queen (I'm queen), of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh
750	53735	33	'Cause I knew too much, there was danger in the heat of my touch
750	53736	34	He saw forever, so he smashed it up, oh, oh
750	53737	35	My boy (My boy), only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh
750	53738	36	
750	53739	37	[Bridge]
750	53740	38	Once I fix me
750	53741	39	He's gonna miss me
750	53742	40	Once I fix me
750	53743	41	He's gonna miss me
750	53744	42	
750	53745	43	[Outro]
750	53746	44	Just say when, I'd play again
750	53747	45	He was my best friend down at the sandlot
750	53748	46	I felt more when we played pretend
750	53749	47	Than with all the Kens
750	53750	48	'Cause he took me out of my box
750	53751	49	Stole my tortured heart
750	53752	50	Left all these broken parts
750	53753	51	Told me I'm better off
750	53754	52	But I'm not
750	53755	53	I'm not, I'm not
751	52990	1	[Verse 1]
751	52991	2	Did you really beam me up
751	52992	3	In a cloud of sparkling dust
751	52993	4	Just to do experiments on?
751	52994	5	Tell me I was the chosen one
751	52995	6	Showed me that this world is bigger than us
751	52996	7	Then sent me back where I came from
751	52997	8	
751	52998	9	[Pre-Chorus]
751	52999	10	For a moment, I knew cosmic love
751	53000	11	
751	53001	12	[Chorus]
751	53002	13	Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym
751	53003	14	Everything comes out teenage petulance
751	53004	15	"Fuck it if I can't have him"
751	53005	16	"I might just die, it would make no difference"
751	53006	17	Down bad, wakin' up in blood
751	53007	18	Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
751	53008	19	Fuck it if I can't have us
751	53009	20	I might just not get up, I might stay
751	53010	21	
751	53011	22	[Post-Chorus]
751	53012	23	Down bad
751	53013	24	Fuck it if I can't have him
751	53014	25	Down bad
751	53015	26	Fuck it if I can't have him
751	53016	27	[Verse 2]
751	53017	28	Did you take all my old clothes
751	53018	29	Just to leave me here, naked and alone
751	53019	30	In a field in my same old town
751	53020	31	That somehow seems so hollow now?
751	53021	32	They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about
751	53022	33	The existence of you
751	53023	34	
751	53024	35	[Pre-Chorus]
751	53025	36	For a moment, I was heavenstruck
751	53026	37	
751	53027	38	[Chorus]
751	53028	39	Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
751	53029	40	Everything comes out teenage petulance
751	53030	41	"Fuck it if I can't have him" (Fuck it if I can't have him)
751	53031	42	"I might just die, it would make no difference"
751	53032	43	Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
751	53033	44	Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
751	53034	45	Fuck it if I can't have us
751	53035	46	I might just not get up, I might stay
751	53036	47	
751	53037	48	[Post-Chorus]
751	53038	49	Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
751	53039	50	Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad)
751	53040	51	Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
751	53041	52	Fuck it if I can't have him
751	53042	53	[Bridge]
751	53043	54	I loved your hostile takeovers
751	53044	55	Encounters closer and closer
751	53045	56	All your indecent exposures
751	53046	57	How dare you say that it's—
751	53047	58	I'll build you a fort on some planet
751	53048	59	Where they can all understand it
751	53049	60	How dare you think it's romantic
751	53050	61	Leaving me safe and stranded
751	53051	62	'Cause fuck it, I was in love
751	53052	63	So fuck you if I can't have us
751	53053	64	'Cause fuck it, I was in love
751	53054	65	
751	53055	66	[Chorus]
751	53056	67	Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
751	53057	68	Everything comes out teenage petulance
751	53058	69	"Fuck it if I can't have him" (Can't have him)
751	53059	70	"I might just die, it would make no difference"
751	53060	71	Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
751	53061	72	Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
751	53062	73	Fuck it if I can't have us
751	53063	74	I might just not get up, I might stay
751	53064	75	
751	53065	76	[Post-Chorus]
751	53066	77	Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
751	53067	78	Fuck it if I can't have him (I'm down bad)
751	53068	79	Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
751	53069	80	Fuck it if I can't have him
751	53070	81	[Outro]
751	53071	82	Like I lost my twin
751	53072	83	Fuck it if I can't have him
751	53073	84	Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
751	53074	85	Fuck it if I can't have him
752	53963	1	[Intro]
752	53964	2	So (So) long (Long), London (London)
752	53965	3	So (So) long (Long), London (London)
752	53966	4	So (So) long (Long), London (London)
752	53967	5	[Verse 1]
752	53968	6	I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist
752	53969	7	I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift
752	53970	8	Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away
752	53971	9	My spine split from carrying us up the hill
752	53972	10	Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill
752	53973	11	I stopped tryna make him laugh, stopped tryna drill the safe
752	53974	12	
752	53975	13	[Chorus]
752	53976	14	Thinkin', "How much sad did you think I had
752	53977	15	Did you think I had in me?"
752	53978	16	Oh, the tragedy
752	53979	17	So long, London
752	53980	18	You'll find someone
752	53981	19	
752	53982	20	[Verse 2]
752	53983	21	I didn't opt in to be your odd man out
752	53984	22	I founded the club she's heard great things about
752	53985	23	I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath
752	53986	24	I stoppеd CPR, after all, it's no use
752	53987	25	The spirit was gonе, we would never come to
752	53988	26	And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free
752	53989	27	[Chorus]
752	53990	28	For so long, London
752	53991	29	Stitches undone
752	53992	30	Two graves, one gun
752	53993	31	I'll find someone
752	53994	32	
752	53995	33	[Bridge]
752	53996	34	And you say I abandoned the ship
752	53997	35	But I was going down with it
752	53998	36	My white-knuckle dying grip
752	53999	37	Holding tight to your quiet resentment
752	54000	38	And my friends said it isn't right to be scared
752	54001	39	Every day of a love affair
752	54002	40	Every breath feels like rarest air
752	54003	41	When you're not sure if he wants to be there
752	54004	42	
752	54005	43	[Chorus]
752	54006	44	So how much sad did you think I had
752	54007	45	Did you think I had in me?
752	54008	46	How much tragedy?
752	54009	47	Just how low did you
752	54010	48	Think I'd go 'fore I'd self-implode?
752	54011	49	'Fore I'd have to go be free?
752	54012	50	
752	54013	51	[Verse 3]
752	54014	52	You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?
752	54015	53	I died on the altar waitin' for the proof
752	54016	54	You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days
752	54017	55	And I'm just getting color back into my face
752	54018	56	I'm just mad as hell 'cause I loved this place for
752	54019	57	[Chorus]
752	54020	58	So (So) long (Long), London (London)
752	54021	59	Had (Had) a (A) good (Good) run (Run)
752	54022	60	A moment (Moment) of warm sun (Sun)
752	54023	61	But I'm (I'm) not (Not) the (The) one (One)
752	54024	62	So (So) long (Long), London (London)
752	54025	63	Stitches (Stitches) undone (Undone)
752	54026	64	Two (Two) graves (Graves) one gun (Gun)
752	54027	65	You'll (You'll) find (Find) someone
753	52712	1	[Verse 1]
753	52713	2	I forget how the West was won
753	52714	3	I forget if this was ever fun
753	52715	4	I just learned these people only raise you
753	52716	5	To cage you
753	52717	6	Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
753	52718	7	Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, "What a mess"
753	52719	8	I just learned these people try and save you
753	52720	9	'Cause they hate you
753	52721	10	
753	52722	11	[Pre-Chorus]
753	52723	12	Too high a horse
753	52724	13	For a simple girl
753	52725	14	To rise above it
753	52726	15	They slammed the door
753	52727	16	On my whole world
753	52728	17	The one thing I wanted
753	52729	18	
753	52730	19	[Chorus]
753	52731	20	Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
753	52732	21	Scrеamin', "But, Daddy, I love him"
753	52733	22	I'm havin' his baby
753	52734	23	No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
753	52735	24	I'm tellin' him to floor it through thе fences
753	52736	25	No, I'm not coming to my senses
753	52737	26	I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want
753	52738	27	[Verse 2]
753	52739	28	Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid
753	52740	29	Tendrils tucked into a woven braid
753	52741	30	Growin' up precocious sometimes means
753	52742	31	Not growin' up at all
753	52743	32	He was chaos, he was revelry
753	52744	33	Bedroom eyes like a remedy
753	52745	34	Soon enough, the elders had convened
753	52746	35	Down at the city hall
753	52747	36	
753	52748	37	[Pre-Chorus]
753	52749	38	"Stay away from her"
753	52750	39	The saboteurs
753	52751	40	Protested too much
753	52752	41	Lord knows the words
753	52753	42	We never heard
753	52754	43	Just screeching tires and true love
753	52755	44	
753	52756	45	[Chorus]
753	52757	46	And I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
753	52758	47	Screamin', "But, Daddy, I love him"
753	52759	48	I'm havin' his baby
753	52760	49	No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
753	52761	50	I'm tellin' him to floor it through the fences
753	52762	51	No, I'm not coming to my senses
753	52763	52	I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want
753	52764	53	[Post-Chorus]
753	52765	54	I'll tell you something right now
753	52766	55	I'd rather burn my whole life down
753	52767	56	Than listen to one more second of all this bitchin' and moanin'
753	52768	57	I'll tell you something 'bout my good name
753	52769	58	It's mine alone to disgrace
753	52770	59	I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing
753	52771	60	
753	52772	61	[Bridge]
753	52773	62	God save the most judgmental creeps
753	52774	63	Who say they want what's best for me
753	52775	64	Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
753	52776	65	Thinkin' it can change the beat
753	52777	66	Of my heart when he touches me
753	52778	67	And counteract the chemistry
753	52779	68	And undo the destiny
753	52780	69	You ain't gotta pray for me
753	52781	70	Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
753	52782	71	If all you want is gray for me
753	52783	72	Then it's just white noise, and it's just my choice
753	52784	73	
753	52785	74	[Verse 3]
753	52786	75	There's a lot of people in town that I
753	52787	76	Bestow upon my fakest smiles
753	52788	77	Scandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer
753	52789	78	We came back when the heat died down
753	52790	79	Went to my parents and they came around
753	52791	80	All the wine moms are still holdin' out, but fuck 'em, it's over
753	52792	81	[Chorus]
753	52793	82	Now I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun and
753	52794	83	Even my daddy just loves him
753	52795	84	I'm his lady
753	52796	85	And, oh my God, you should see your faces
753	52797	86	Time, doesn't it give some perspective?
753	52798	87	And, no, you can't come to the wedding
753	52799	88	I know it's crazy, but he's the one I want
753	52800	89	
753	52801	90	[Post-Chorus]
753	52802	91	I'll tell you something right now
753	52803	92	You ain't gotta pray for me
753	52804	93	Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
753	52805	94	(He was chaos, he was revelry)
753	52806	95	If all you want is gray for me
753	52807	96	Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice
753	52808	97	
753	52809	98	[Outro]
753	52810	99	Screamin', "But, Daddy, I love him"
753	52811	100	I'm having his baby
753	52812	101	No, I'm not
753	52813	102	But you should see your faces
753	52814	103	But, oh my God, you should see your faces
753	52815	104	(He was chaos, he was revelry)
753	52816	105	(He was chaos, he was revelry)1
754	53202	1	[Intro]
754	53203	2	Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
754	53204	3	Fresh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
754	53205	4	(Fresh out the slammer, oh)
754	53206	5	
754	53207	6	[Verse 1]
754	53208	7	Another summer takin' cover, rolling thunder
754	53209	8	He don't understand me
754	53210	9	Splintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter
754	53211	10	He was with her in dreams
754	53212	11	
754	53213	12	[Pre-Chorus]
754	53214	13	Gray and blue and fights and tunnels
754	53215	14	Handcuffed to the spell I was under
754	53216	15	For just one hour of sunshine
754	53217	16	Years of labor, locks, and ceilings
754	53218	17	In the shade of how he was feeling
754	53219	18	But it's gonna be alright, I did my time
754	53220	19	
754	53221	20	[Chorus]
754	53222	21	Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
754	53223	22	Frеsh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
754	53224	23	(Frеsh out the slammer, oh)
754	53225	24	
754	53226	25	[Verse 2]
754	53227	26	Camera flashes, welcome bashes, get the matches
754	53228	27	Toss the ashes off the ledge
754	53229	28	As I said in my letters, now that I know better
754	53230	29	I will never lose my baby again
754	53231	30	[Pre-Chorus]
754	53232	31	My friends tried, but I wouldn't hear it
754	53233	32	Watch me daily disappearing
754	53234	33	For just one glimpse of his smile
754	53235	34	All those nights, he kept me goin'
754	53236	35	Swirled you into all of my poems
754	53237	36	Now we're at the starting line, I did my time
754	53238	37	
754	53239	38	[Chorus]
754	53240	39	Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin'
754	53241	40	
754	53242	41	[Bridge]
754	53243	42	To the house where you still wait up and that porch light gleams (Gleams)
754	53244	43	To the one who says I'm the girl of his American dreams
754	53245	44	And no matter what I've done, it wouldn't matter anyway
754	53246	45	Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up now that I know what's at stake here
754	53247	46	At the park where we used to sit on children's swings
754	53248	47	Wearing imaginary rings
754	53249	48	
754	53250	49	[Outro]
754	53251	50	But it's gonna be alright, I did my time
755	53075	1	[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
755	53076	2	You can beat the heat if you beat the charges too
755	53077	3	They said I was a cheat, I guess it must be true
755	53078	4	And my friends all smell like weed or little babies
755	53079	5	And this city reeks of driving myself crazy
755	53080	6	
755	53081	7	[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
755	53082	8	Little did you know your home's really only
755	53083	9	A town you're just a guest in
755	53084	10	So you work your life away just to pay
755	53085	11	For a time-share down in Destin
755	53086	12	
755	53087	13	[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Florence Welch, Taylor Swift]
755	53088	14	Florida
755	53089	15	Is one hell of a drug
755	53090	16	Florida
755	53091	17	Can I use you up?
755	53092	18	
755	53093	19	[Verse 2: Florence Welch, Taylor Swift & Florence Welch]
755	53094	20	The hurricane with my name when it came
755	53095	21	I got drunk and I dared it to wash me away
755	53096	22	Barricaded in the bathroom with a bottle of wine
755	53097	23	Well, me and my ghosts, wе had a hell of a time
755	53098	24	Yes, I'm hauntеd, but I'm feeling just fine
755	53099	25	All my girls got their lace and their crimes
755	53100	26	And your cheating husband disappeared, well
755	53101	27	No one asks any questions here
755	53102	28	So I did my best to lay to rest
755	53103	29	All of the bodies that have ever been on my body
755	53104	30	And in my mind, they sink into the swamp
755	53105	31	Is that a bad thing to say in a song?
755	53106	32	[Pre-Chorus: Florence Welch]
755	53107	33	Little did you know your home's really only
755	53108	34	The town you'll get arrested
755	53109	35	So you pack your life away just to wait out
755	53110	36	The shitstorm back in Texas
755	53111	37	
755	53112	38	[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Florence Welch, Taylor Swift]
755	53113	39	Florida
755	53114	40	Is one hell of a drug
755	53115	41	Florida
755	53116	42	Can I use you up?
755	53117	43	
755	53118	44	[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Florence Welch, Taylor Swift & Florence Welch]
755	53119	45	I need to forget, so take me to Florida
755	53120	46	I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida
755	53121	47	Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable
755	53122	48	At least the dolls are beautiful, fuck me up, Florida
755	53123	49	I need to forget, so take me to Florida
755	53124	50	I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida
755	53125	51	Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable
755	53126	52	What a crash, what a rush, fuck me up, Florida
755	53127	53	It's one hell of a drug
755	53128	54	It's one hell of a drug
755	53129	55	Love left me like this and I don't want to exist
755	53130	56	So take me to Florida
755	53131	57	[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Florence Welch, Florence Welch]
755	53132	58	Little did you know your home's really only
755	53133	59	A town you're just a guest in (Florida)
755	53134	60	So you work your life away just to pay
755	53135	61	For a time-share down in Destin (Take me to Florida)
755	53136	62	Little did you know your home's really only
755	53137	63	The town you'll get arrested (Florida)
755	53138	64	So you pack your life away just to wait out
755	53139	65	The shitstorm back in Texas
755	53140	66	
755	53141	67	[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Florence Welch, Taylor Swift]
755	53142	68	Florida
755	53143	69	Is one hell of a drug
755	53144	70	(Take me to) Florida
755	53145	71	Can I use you up?
755	53146	72	Florida
755	53147	73	Is one hell of a drug
755	53148	74	Florida
755	53149	75	Go on, fuck me up
756	53252	1	[Verse 1]
756	53253	2	Drownin' in the Blue Nile
756	53254	3	He sent me "Downtown Lights"
756	53255	4	I hadn't heard it in a while
756	53256	5	My boredom's bone-deep
756	53257	6	This cage was once just fine
756	53258	7	Am I allowed to cry?
756	53259	8	I dream of crackin' locks
756	53260	9	Throwin' my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks
756	53261	10	Crashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox
756	53262	11	I'm seeing visions
756	53263	12	Am I bad or mad or wise?
756	53264	13	
756	53265	14	[Chorus]
756	53266	15	What if he's written "mine" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
756	53267	16	One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
756	53268	17	Oh, what a way to die
756	53269	18	I keep recalling things we never did
756	53270	19	Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
756	53271	20	Without ever touchin' his skin
756	53272	21	How can I be guilty as sin?
756	53273	22	
756	53274	23	[Verse 2]
756	53275	24	I keep these longings lockеd
756	53276	25	In lowercase, inside a vault
756	53277	26	Somеone told me, "There's no such thing as bad thoughts
756	53278	27	Only your actions talk"
756	53279	28	These fatal fantasies
756	53280	29	Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me
756	53281	30	We've already done it in my head
756	53282	31	If it's make-believe
756	53283	32	Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?
756	53284	33	[Chorus]
756	53285	34	What if he's written "mine" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
756	53286	35	One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
756	53287	36	Oh, what a way to die
756	53288	37	My bed sheets are ablaze
756	53289	38	I've screamed his name
756	53290	39	Buildin' up like waves crashin' over my grave
756	53291	40	Without ever touchin' his skin
756	53292	41	How can I be guilty as sin?
756	53293	42	
756	53294	43	[Bridge]
756	53295	44	What if I roll the stone away?
756	53296	45	They're gonna crucify me anyway
756	53297	46	What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?
756	53298	47	If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me
756	53299	48	They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly
756	53300	49	I choose you and me religiously
756	53301	50	
756	53302	51	[Chorus]
756	53303	52	What if he's written "mine" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
756	53304	53	One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
756	53305	54	Oh, what a way to die
756	53306	55	I keep recalling things we never did
756	53307	56	Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
756	53308	57	Without ever touchin' his skin
756	53309	58	How can I be guilty as sin?
756	53310	59	[Outro]
756	53311	60	He sent me "Downtown Lights"
756	53312	61	I hadn't heard it in a while
756	53313	62	Am I allowed to cry?
757	54603	1	[Verse 1]
757	54604	2	The who's who of "Who's that?" is poised for the attack
757	54605	3	But my bare hands paved their paths
757	54606	4	You don't get to tell me about "sad"
757	54607	5	
757	54608	6	[Pre-Chorus]
757	54609	7	If you wanted me dead, you should've just said
757	54610	8	Nothing makes me feel more alive
757	54611	9	
757	54612	10	[Chorus]
757	54613	11	So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
757	54614	12	Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
757	54615	13	"Who's afraid of little old me?"
757	54616	14	You should be
757	54617	15	
757	54618	16	[Verse 2]
757	54619	17	The scandal was contained
757	54620	18	The bullet had just grazed
757	54621	19	At all costs, keep your good name
757	54622	20	You don't get to tell me you feel bad
757	54623	21	
757	54624	22	[Pre-Chorus]
757	54625	23	Is it a wonder I broke? Let's hear one morе joke
757	54626	24	Then we could all just laugh until I cry
757	54627	25	
757	54628	26	[Chorus]
757	54629	27	So I lеap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
757	54630	28	Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
757	54631	29	"Who's afraid of little old me?"
757	54632	30	I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean
757	54633	31	"Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth"
757	54634	32	Who's afraid of little old me?
757	54635	33	Well, you should be
757	54636	34	[Post-Chorus]
757	54637	35	(You should be) You should be
757	54638	36	(You should be) You should be
757	54639	37	You should be (You should be)
757	54640	38	You should be (You should be)
757	54641	39	You should be
757	54642	40	
757	54643	41	[Bridge]
757	54644	42	So tell me everything is not about me
757	54645	43	But what if it is?
757	54646	44	Then say they didn't do it to hurt me
757	54647	45	But what if they did?
757	54648	46	I wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me
757	54649	47	You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me
757	54650	48	So all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs
757	54651	49	I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?
757	54652	50	That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn
757	54653	51	That I'm fearsome and I'm wretched and I'm wrong
757	54654	52	Put narcotics into all of my songs
757	54655	53	And that's why you're still singin' along
757	54656	54	
757	54657	55	[Chorus]
757	54658	56	So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
757	54659	57	Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
757	54660	58	"Who's afraid of little old me?"
757	54661	59	I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean
757	54662	60	"Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth"
757	54663	61	Who's afraid of little old me?
757	54664	62	Well, you should be
757	54665	63	[Post-Chorus]
757	54666	64	(You should be) You should be
757	54667	65	(You should be) You should be
757	54668	66	'Cause you lured me (You should be)
757	54669	67	And you hurt me (You should be)
757	54670	68	And you taught me
757	54671	69	
757	54672	70	[Outro]
757	54673	71	You caged me and then you called me crazy
757	54674	72	I am what I am 'cause you trained me
757	54675	73	So who's afraid of me?
757	54676	74	Who's afraid of little old me?
757	54677	75	Who's afraid of little old me?
759	53639	1	[Verse 1]
759	53640	2	Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames
759	53641	3	If we know the steps anyway?
759	53642	4	We embroidered the memories of the time I was away
759	53643	5	Stitching, "We were just kids, babe"
759	53644	6	I said, "I don't mind, it takes time"
759	53645	7	I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed
759	53646	8	I felt aglow like this
759	53647	9	Never before and never since
759	53648	10	
759	53649	11	[Chorus]
759	53650	12	If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
759	53651	13	You and I go from one kiss to getting married
759	53652	14	Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery
759	53653	15	Never quite buried
759	53654	16	In your suit and tie, in the nick of time
759	53655	17	You low-down boy, you stand-up guy
759	53656	18	You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life
759	53657	19	You said I'm the love of your life
759	53658	20	About a million times
759	53659	21	
759	53660	22	[Verse 2]
759	53661	23	Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate
759	53662	24	And told me I reformed you?
759	53663	25	When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
759	53664	26	Well, you took me to hell too
759	53665	27	And all at once, the ink bleeds
759	53666	28	A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme
759	53667	29	But I've felt a hole like this
759	53668	30	Never before and ever since
759	53669	31	[Chorus]
759	53670	32	If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
759	53671	33	What we thought was for all time was momentary
759	53672	34	Still alive, killing time at the cemetery
759	53673	35	Never quite buried
759	53674	36	You cinephile in black and white
759	53675	37	All those plot twists and dynamite
759	53676	38	Mr. Steal Your Girl, then make her cry
759	53677	39	You said I'm the love of your life
759	53678	40	
759	53679	41	[Bridge]
759	53680	42	You shit-talked me under the table
759	53681	43	Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles
759	53682	44	I wish I could un-recall
759	53683	45	How we almost had it all
759	53684	46	Dancing phantoms on the terrace
759	53685	47	Are they second-hand embarrassed
759	53686	48	That I can't get out of bed
759	53687	49	'Cause something counterfeit's dead?
759	53688	50	It was legendary
759	53689	51	It was momentary
759	53690	52	It was unnecessary
759	53691	53	Should've let it stay buried
759	53692	54	
759	53693	55	[Chorus]
759	53694	56	Oh, what a valiant roar
759	53695	57	What a bland goodbye
759	53696	58	The coward claimed he was a lion
759	53697	59	I'm combing through the braids of lies
759	53698	60	"I'll never leave," "Never mind"
759	53699	61	Our field of dreams engulfed in fire
759	53700	62	Your arson's match, your somber eyes
759	53701	63	And I'll still see it until I die
759	53702	64	You're the loss of my life
760	53368	1	[Verse 1]
760	53430	1	[Verse 1]
760	53431	2	The smoke cloud billows out his mouth
760	53369	2	I can read your mind
760	53370	3	"She's having the time of her life"
760	53432	3	Like a freight train through a small town
760	53433	4	The jokes that he told across the bar
760	53371	4	There in her glittering prime
760	53372	5	The lights refract sequin stars off her silhouette every night
760	53434	5	Were revolting and far too loud
760	53435	6	
760	53373	6	I can show you lies
760	53374	7	(One, two, three, four)
760	53436	7	[Chorus]
760	53437	8	They shake their heads sayin', "God, help her"
760	53375	8	
760	53376	9	[Pre-Chorus]
760	53438	9	When I tell 'em he's my man
760	53439	10	But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger
760	53377	10	'Cause I'm a real tough kid
760	53378	11	I can handle my shit
760	53440	11	I can fix him, no, really, I can
760	53441	12	And only I can
760	53379	12	They said, "Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it" and I did
760	53380	13	Lights, camera, bitch, smile
760	53442	13	
760	53443	14	[Verse 2]
760	53381	14	Even when you wanna die
760	53382	15	He said he'd love me all his life
760	53444	15	The dopamine races through his brain
760	53445	16	On a six-lane Texas highway
760	53383	16	But that life was too short
760	53384	17	Breaking down, I hit the floor
760	53446	17	His hand so calloused from his pistol
760	53447	18	Softly traces hearts on my face
760	53385	18	All the piеces of me shatterеd as the crowd was chanting, "More"
760	53386	19	I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
760	53448	19	And I could see it from a mile away
760	53449	20	A perfect case for my certain skill set
760	53387	20	I was hittin' my marks
760	53388	21	'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
760	53450	21	He had a halo of the highest gradе
760	53451	22	He just hadn't met me yеt
760	53389	22	(One, two, three, four)
760	53390	23	[Chorus]
760	53452	23	
760	53453	24	[Chorus]
760	53391	24	I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
760	53392	25	I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me like the plague
760	53454	25	They shake their heads sayin', "God, help her"
760	53455	26	When I tell 'em he's my man
760	53393	26	I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
760	53394	27	You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
760	53456	27	But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger
760	53457	28	I can fix him, no, really, I can
760	53395	28	[Verse 2]
760	53396	29	I can hold my breath
760	53458	29	And only I can
760	53459	30	[Bridge]
760	53397	30	I've been doin' it since he left
760	53398	31	I keep finding his things in drawers
760	53460	31	Good boy, that's right, come close
760	53461	32	I'll show you Heaven if you'll be an angel, all night
760	53399	32	Crucial evidence I didn't imagine the whole thing
760	53400	33	I'm sure I can pass this test
760	53462	33	Trust me, I can handle me a dangerous man
760	53463	34	No, really, I can
760	53401	34	(One, two, three, four)
760	53402	35	
760	53464	35	
760	53465	36	[Chorus]
760	53403	36	[Pre-Chorus]
760	53404	37	'Cause I'm a real tough kid
760	53466	37	They shook their heads sayin', "God, help her"
760	53467	38	When I told 'em he's my man (I told 'em he's my man)
760	53405	38	I can handle my shit
760	53406	39	They said, "Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it" and I did
760	53468	39	But your good Lord didn't need to lift a finger
760	53469	40	I can fix him, no, really, I can (No, really, I can)
760	53407	40	Lights, camera, bitch, smile
760	53408	41	In stilettos for miles
760	53470	41	Woah, maybe I can't
760	53409	42	He said he'd love me for all time
760	53410	43	But that time was quite short
760	53411	44	Breaking down, I hit the floor
760	53412	45	All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, "More"
760	53413	46	I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
760	53414	47	I was hittin' my marks
760	53415	48	'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
760	53416	49	(One, two, three, four)
760	53417	50	
760	53418	51	[Chorus]
760	53419	52	I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
760	53420	53	I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me (He avoids me), like the plague
760	53421	54	I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
760	53422	55	You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
760	53423	56	[Outro]
760	53424	57	You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
760	53425	58	You know you're good
760	53426	59	And I'm good
760	53427	60	'Cause I'm miserable (Haha)
760	53428	61	And nobody even knows
760	53429	62	Ah, try and come for my job
761	54469	1	[Verse 1]
761	54470	2	Was any of it true?
761	54471	3	Gazing at me starry-eyed
761	54472	4	In your Jehovah's Witness suit
761	54473	5	Who the fuck was that guy?
761	54474	6	You tried to buy some pills
761	54475	7	From a friend of friends of mine
761	54476	8	They just ghosted you
761	54477	9	Now you know what it feels like
761	54478	10	
761	54479	11	[Chorus]
761	54480	12	And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
761	54481	13	If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
761	54482	14	And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
761	54483	15	A message to the smallest man who ever lived?
761	54484	16	
761	54485	17	[Verse 2]
761	54486	18	You hung me on your wall
761	54487	19	Stabbed me with your push pins
761	54488	20	In public, showed me off
761	54489	21	Then sank in stoned oblivion
761	54490	22	'Cause once your queen had come
761	54491	23	You'd treat her likе an also-ran
761	54492	24	You didn't measure up
761	54493	25	In any measurе of a man
761	54494	26	[Chorus]
761	54495	27	And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
761	54496	28	If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
761	54497	29	And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
761	54498	30	A message to the smallest man who ever lived?
761	54499	31	
761	54500	32	[Bridge]
761	54501	33	Were you sent by someone who wanted me dead?
761	54502	34	Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?
761	54503	35	Were you writin' a book? Were you a sleeper cell spy?
761	54504	36	In fifty years, will all this be declassified?
761	54505	37	And you'll confess why you did it and I'll say, "Good riddance"
761	54506	38	'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden
761	54507	39	I would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside
761	54508	40	And you deserve prison, but you won't get time
761	54509	41	You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars
761	54510	42	You crashed my party and your rental car
761	54511	43	You said normal girls were boring
761	54512	44	But you were gone by the morning
761	54513	45	You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing
761	54514	46	
761	54515	47	[Outro]
761	54516	48	And in plain sight you hid
761	54517	49	But you are what you did
761	54518	50	And I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive
761	54519	51	The smallest man who ever lived
762	54149	1	[Verse 1]
762	54150	2	This happens once every few lifetimes
762	54151	3	These chemicals hit me like white wine
762	54152	4	What if I told you I'm back?
762	54153	5	The hospital was a drag
762	54154	6	Worst sleep that I ever had
762	54155	7	I circled you on a map
762	54156	8	I haven't come around in so long
762	54157	9	But I'm coming back so strong
762	54158	10	
762	54159	11	[Chorus]
762	54160	12	So when I touch down
762	54161	13	Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
762	54162	14	Ditch the clowns, get the crown
762	54163	15	Baby, I'm the one to beat
762	54164	16	'Cause the sign on your heart
762	54165	17	Said it's still reserved for me
762	54166	18	Honestly, who are we to fight thе alchemy?
762	54167	19	
762	54168	20	[Verse 2]
762	54169	21	Hey, you, what if I told you we'rе cool?
762	54170	22	That child's play back in school
762	54171	23	Is forgiven under my rule
762	54172	24	I haven't come around in so long
762	54173	25	But I'm making a comeback to where I belong
762	54174	26	[Chorus]
762	54175	27	So when I touch down
762	54176	28	Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
762	54177	29	Ditch the clowns, get the crown
762	54178	30	Baby, I'm the one to beat
762	54179	31	'Cause the sign on your heart
762	54180	32	Said it's still reserved for me
762	54181	33	Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?
762	54182	34	These blokes warm the benches
762	54183	35	We've been on a winning streak
762	54184	36	He jokes that it's heroin, but this time with an "E"
762	54185	37	'Cause the sign on your heart
762	54186	38	Said it's still reserved for me
762	54187	39	Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?
762	54188	40	
762	54189	41	[Bridge]
762	54190	42	Shirts off and your friends lift you up over their heads
762	54191	43	Beer stickin' to the floor, cheers chanted 'cause they said
762	54192	44	"There was no chance trying to be the greatest in the league"
762	54193	45	Where's the trophy? He just comes runnin' over to me
762	54194	46	
762	54195	47	[Chorus]
762	54196	48	Touchdown
762	54197	49	Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
762	54198	50	Ditch the clowns, get the crown
762	54199	51	Baby, I'm the one to beat
762	54200	52	'Cause the sign on your heart
762	54201	53	Said it's still reserved for me

762	54209	61	[Outro]
762	54210	62	This happens once every few lifetimes
762	54211	63	These chemicals hit me like white wine
763	52939	1	[Verse 1]
763	52940	2	"You look like Clara Bow
763	52941	3	In this light, remarkable
763	52942	4	All your life, did you know
763	52943	5	You'd be picked like a rose?"
763	52944	6	
763	52945	7	[Pre-Chorus]
763	52946	8	"I'm not trying to exaggerate
763	52947	9	But I think I might die if it happened
763	52948	10	Die if it happened to me
763	52949	11	No one in my small town
763	52950	12	Thought I'd see the lights of Manhattan"
763	52951	13	
763	52952	14	[Chorus]
763	52953	15	"This town is fake, but you're the real thing
763	52954	16	Breath of fresh air through smoke rings
763	52955	17	Take the glory, give everything
763	52956	18	Promise to be dazzling"
763	52957	19	[Verse 2]
763	52958	20	"You look like Stevie Nicks
763	52959	21	In '75, the hair and lips
763	52960	22	Crowd goes wild at her fingertips
763	52961	23	Half moonshine, a full еclipse"
763	52962	24	
763	52963	25	[Pre-Chorus]
763	52964	26	"I'm not trying to exaggeratе
763	52965	27	But I think I might die if I made it, die if I made it
763	52966	28	No one in my small town thought I'd meet these suits in L.A.
763	52967	29	They all wanna say..."
763	52968	30	[Chorus]
763	52969	31	"This town is fake, but you're the real thing
763	52970	32	Breath of fresh air through smoke rings
763	52971	33	Take the glory, give everything
763	52972	34	Promise to be dazzling
763	52973	35	The crown is stained, but you're the real queen
763	52974	36	Flesh and blood amongst war machines
763	52975	37	You're the new god we're worshipping
763	52976	38	Promise to be dazzling"
763	52977	39	
763	52978	40	[Bridge]
763	52979	41	Beauty is a beast that roars down on all fours
763	52980	42	Demanding more
763	52981	43	Only when your girlish glow flickers just so
763	52982	44	Do they let you know
763	52983	45	It's hell on earth to be heavenly
763	52984	46	Them's the breaks, they don't come gently
763	52985	47	[Outro]
763	52986	48	"You look like Taylor Swift
763	52987	49	In this light, we're lovin' it
763	52988	50	You've got edge, she never did
763	52989	51	The future's bright, dazzling"
764	54212	1	[Verse 1]
764	54213	2	I am someone who until recent events
764	54214	3	You shared your secrets with
764	54215	4	And your location, you forgot to turn it off
764	54216	5	And so I watch as you walk
764	54217	6	Into some bar called The Black Dog
764	54218	7	And pierce new holes in my heart
764	54219	8	You forgot to turn it off
764	54220	9	And it hits me
764	54221	10	
764	54222	11	[Chorus]
764	54223	12	I just don't understand
764	54224	13	How you don't miss me in The Black Dog
764	54225	14	When someone plays "The Starting Line"
764	54226	15	And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song
764	54227	16	That was intertwined in the magic fabric of our dreaming
764	54228	17	Old habits die screaming
764	54229	18	
764	54230	19	[Verse 2]
764	54231	20	I move through the world with the heartbroken
764	54232	21	My longings stay unspoken
764	54233	22	And I may never open up thе way I did for you
764	54234	23	And all of those best laid plans
764	54235	24	You said I needed a bravе man
764	54236	25	Then proceeded to play him
764	54237	26	Until I believed it too
764	54238	27	And it kills me
764	54239	28	[Chorus]
764	54240	29	I just don't understand
764	54241	30	How you don't miss me in the shower
764	54242	31	And remember how my rain-soaked body
764	54243	32	Was shakin', do you hate me?
764	54244	33	Was it hazing? For a cruel fraternity
764	54245	34	I pledged and I still mean it
764	54246	35	Old habits die screaming
764	54247	36	
764	54248	37	[Bridge]
764	54249	38	Six weeks of breathin' clean air
764	54250	39	I still miss the smoke
764	54251	40	Were you makin' fun of me
764	54252	41	With some esoteric joke?
764	54253	42	Now I wanna sell my house
764	54254	43	And set fire to all my clothes
764	54255	44	And hire a priest to come and exorcise my demons
764	54256	45	Even if I die screaming
764	54257	46	And I hope you hear it
764	54258	47	
764	54259	48	[Chorus]
764	54260	49	And I hope it's shitty in The Black Dog
764	54261	50	When someone plays "The Starting Line"
764	54262	51	And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song
764	54263	52	That was intertwined in the tragic fabric of our dreaming
764	54264	53	'Cause tail between your legs, you're leavin'
764	54265	54	[Outro]
764	54266	55	I still can't believe it
764	54267	56	'Cause old habits die screaming
765	53568	1	[Intro]
765	53569	2	Yeah
765	53570	3	
765	53571	4	[Verse 1]
765	53572	5	Lilac short skirt, the one that fits me like skin
765	53573	6	Did your research, you knew the price goin' in
765	53574	7	And I'll tell you one thing, honey
765	53575	8	I can tell when somebody still wants me, come clean
765	53576	9	Standin' at the bar like something's funny, bubbly
765	53577	10	Once you fix your face, I'm goin' in (Yeah)
765	53578	11	
765	53579	12	[Chorus]
765	53580	13	Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
765	53581	14	Gonna smash up your bike, I haven't decided yet
765	53582	15	But I'm gonna get you back
765	53583	16	Whether I'm gonna curse you out or
765	53584	17	Take you back to my house, I haven't decidеd yet
765	53585	18	But I'm gonna get you back
765	53586	19	
765	53587	20	[Post-Chorus]
765	53588	21	I, I hear thе whispers in your eyes
765	53589	22	I'll make you wanna think twice
765	53590	23	You'll find that you were never not mine
765	53591	24	(You're mine)
765	53592	25	
765	53593	26	[Verse 2]
765	53594	27	Small talk, big love, act like I don't care what you did
765	53595	28	I'm an Aston Martin that you steered straight into the ditch
765	53596	29	Then ran and hid
765	53597	30	And I'll tell you one thing, honey
765	53598	31	I can take the upper hand and touch your body
765	53599	32	Flip the script and leave you like a dumb house party
765	53600	33	Or I might just love you 'til the end
765	53601	34	[Chorus]
765	53602	35	Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
765	53603	36	Gonna smash up your bike, I haven't decided yet
765	53604	37	But I'm gonna get you back
765	53605	38	Whether I'm gonna flip you off or
765	53606	39	Pull you into the closet, I haven't decided yet
765	53607	40	But I'm gonna get you back
765	53608	41	
765	53609	42	[Post-Chorus]
765	53610	43	I, I hear the whispers in your eyes
765	53611	44	I'll make you wanna think twice
765	53612	45	You'll find that you were never not mine
765	53613	46	(You're mine)
765	53614	47	
765	53615	48	[Bridge]
765	53616	49	I can feel it coming, humming in the way you move
765	53617	50	Push the reset button, we're becomin' something new
765	53618	51	Say you got somebody, I'll say I got someone too
765	53619	52	Even if it's handcuffed, I'm leavin' here with you
765	53620	53	Bygones will be bygone, eras fadin' into gray (Fading into gray)
765	53621	54	We broke all the pieces, but still wanna play the game (Oh)
765	53622	55	Told my friends I hate you, but I love you just the same
765	53623	56	Pick your poison, babe, I'm poison either way
765	53624	57	
765	53625	58	[Chorus]
765	53626	59	Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
765	53627	60	Gonna smash up your bike, I haven't decided yet
765	53628	61	But I'm gonna get you back
765	53629	62	Whether I'm gonna curse you out or
765	53630	63	Take you back to my house, I haven't decided yet
765	53631	64	But I'm gonna get you back
765	53632	65	[Post-Chorus]
765	53633	66	I, I hear the whispers in your eyes
765	53634	67	I'll make you wanna think twice
765	53635	68	You'll find that you were never not mine
765	53636	69	
765	53637	70	[Outro]
765	53638	71	I'm gonna get you back
766	54089	1	[Verse 1]
766	54090	2	Wise men once said
766	54091	3	"Wild winds are death to the candle"
766	54092	4	A rose by any other name is a scandal
766	54093	5	Cautions issued, he stood
766	54094	6	Shooting the messengers
766	54095	7	They tried to warn him about her
766	54096	8	
766	54097	9	[Chorus]
766	54098	10	Cross your thoughtless heart
766	54099	11	Only liquor anoints you
766	54100	12	She's the albatross
766	54101	13	She is here to destroy you
766	54102	14	
766	54103	15	[Verse 2]
766	54104	16	Wise men once said
766	54105	17	"One bad seed kills the garden"
766	54106	18	"One less temptress, one less dagger to sharpen"
766	54107	19	Locked me up in towers
766	54108	20	But I'd visit in your dreams
766	54109	21	And they tried to warn you about me
766	54110	22	
766	54111	23	[Chorus]
766	54112	24	Cross your thoughtless heart
766	54113	25	Only liquor anoints you
766	54114	26	She's the albatross
766	54115	27	She is here to destroy you
766	54116	28	Devils that you know
766	54117	29	Raise worse hell than a stranger
766	54118	30	She's the death you chose
766	54119	31	You're in terrible danger
766	54120	32	[Bridge]
766	54121	33	And when that sky rains fire on you
766	54122	34	And you're persona non grata
766	54123	35	I'll tell you how I've been there too
766	54124	36	And that none of it matters
766	54125	37	
766	54126	38	[Verse 3]
766	54127	39	Wise men once read fake news
766	54128	40	And they believed it
766	54129	41	Jackals raised their hackles
766	54130	42	You couldn't conceive it
766	54131	43	You were sleeping soundly
766	54132	44	When they dragged you from your bed
766	54133	45	And I tried to warn you about them
766	54134	46	
766	54135	47	[Chorus]
766	54136	48	So I crossed my thoughtless heart
766	54137	49	Spread my wings like a parachute
766	54138	50	I'm the albatross
766	54139	51	I swept in at the rescue
766	54140	52	The devil that you know
766	54141	53	Looks now more like an angel
766	54142	54	I'm the life you chose
766	54143	55	And all this terrible danger
766	54144	56	(This terrible danger)
766	54145	57	[Outro]
766	54146	58	So cross your thoughtless heart
766	54147	59	She's the albatross
766	54148	60	She is here to destroy you
767	52883	1	[Verse 1]
767	52884	2	Your hologram stumbled into my apartment
767	52885	3	Hands in the hair of somebody in darkness
767	52886	4	Named Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus
767	52887	5	And I just watched it happen
767	52888	6	As the decade would play us for fools
767	52889	7	And you saw my bones out with somebody new
767	52890	8	Who seemed like he would've bullied you in school
767	52891	9	And you just watched it happen
767	52892	10	
767	52893	11	[Chorus]
767	52894	12	If you wanna break my cold, cold heart
767	52895	13	Just say, "I loved you the way that you were"
767	52896	14	If you wanna tear my world apart
767	52897	15	Just say you've always wondered
767	52898	16	
767	52899	17	[Verse 2]
767	52900	18	You said some things that I can't unabsorb
767	52901	19	You turned me into an idea of sorts
767	52902	20	You needed me, but you needed drugs more
767	52903	21	And I couldn't watch it happen
767	52904	22	I changed into goddesses, villains, and fools
767	52905	23	Changed plans and lovers and outfits and rules
767	52906	24	All to outrun my desertion of you
767	52907	25	And you just watched it
767	52908	26	[Chorus]
767	52909	27	If you wanna break my cold, cold heart
767	52910	28	Just say, "I loved you the way that you were"
767	52911	29	If you wanna tear my world apart
767	52912	30	Just say you've always wondered
767	52913	31	
767	52914	32	[Bridge]
767	52915	33	If the glint in my eye traced the depths of your sigh
767	52916	34	Down that passage in time back to the moment
767	52917	35	I crashed into you, like so many wrecks do
767	52918	36	Too impaired by my youth to know what to do
767	52919	37	
767	52920	38	[Verse 3]
767	52921	39	So if I sell my apartment
767	52922	40	And you have some kids with an internet starlet
767	52923	41	Will that make your memory fade from this scarlet maroon
767	52924	42	Like it never happened?
767	52925	43	Could it be enough to just float in your orbit?
767	52926	44	Can we watch our phantoms like watching wild horses?
767	52927	45	Cooler in theory, but not if you force it to be
767	52928	46	It just didn't happen
767	52929	47	
767	52930	48	[Chorus]
767	52931	49	So if you wanna break my cold, cold heart
767	52932	50	Say you loved me
767	52933	51	And if you wanna tear my world apart
767	52934	52	Say you'll always wonder
767	52935	53	[Outro]
767	52936	54	'Cause I wonder
767	52937	55	Will I always
767	52938	56	Will I always wonder?
768	53314	1	[Intro]
768	53315	2	(Uh-oh, uh-oh)
768	53316	3	
768	53317	4	[Verse 1]
768	53318	5	We hereby conduct this post-mortem
768	53319	6	He was a hot house flower to my outdoorsman
768	53320	7	Our maladies were such we could not cure them
768	53321	8	And so a touch that was my birthright became foreign
768	53322	9	
768	53323	10	[Chorus]
768	53324	11	Come one, come all, it's happenin' again
768	53325	12	The empathetic hunger descends
768	53326	13	We'll tell no one except all of our friends
768	53327	14	We must know
768	53328	15	How did it end?
768	53329	16	(Uh-oh, uh-oh)
768	53330	17	
768	53331	18	[Verse 2]
768	53332	19	We were blind to unforeseen circumstances
768	53333	20	We learned thе right steps to different dancеs
768	53334	21	And fell victim to interlopers' glances
768	53335	22	Lost the game of chance, what are the chances?
768	53336	23	Soon, they'll go home to their husbands
768	53337	24	Smug 'cause they know they can trust him
768	53338	25	Then feverishly calling their cousins
768	53339	26	[Chorus]
768	53340	27	"Guess who we ran into at the shops?
768	53341	28	Walking in circles like she was lost
768	53342	29	Didn't you hear? They called it all off"
768	53343	30	One gasp and then
768	53344	31	"How did it end?"
768	53345	32	
768	53346	33	[Bridge]
768	53347	34	Say it once again with feeling
768	53348	35	How the death rattle breathing
768	53349	36	Silenced as the soul was leaving
768	53350	37	The deflation of our dreaming
768	53351	38	Leaving me bereft and reeling
768	53352	39	My beloved ghost and me
768	53353	40	Sitting in a tree
768	53354	41	D-Y-I-N-G
768	53355	42	
768	53356	43	[Pre-Chorus]
768	53357	44	It's happenin' again
768	53358	45	How did it end?
768	53359	46	I can't pretend like I understand
768	53360	47	How did it end?
768	53361	48	
768	53362	49	[Chorus]
768	53363	50	Come one, come all, it's happenin' again
768	53364	51	The empathetic hunger descends
768	53365	52	We'll tell no one except all of our friends
768	53366	53	But I still don't know
768	53367	54	How did it end
769	53891	1	[Intro]
769	53892	2	I feel so high school every time I look at you
769	53893	3	I wanna find you in a crowd just to hide from you
769	53894	4	
769	53895	5	[Chorus]
769	53896	6	And in a blink of a crinklin' eye
769	53897	7	I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined
769	53898	8	Cheeks pink in the twinklin' lights
769	53899	9	Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me
769	53900	10	I'll drink what you think and I'm high
769	53901	11	From smokin' your jokes all damn night
769	53902	12	The brink of a wrinkle in time
769	53903	13	Bittersweet sixteen suddenly
769	53904	14	
769	53905	15	[Post-Chorus]
769	53906	16	I'm watchin' American Pie with you on a Saturday night
769	53907	17	Your friends are around, so be quiet
769	53908	18	I'm tryin' to stifle my sighs
769	53909	19	'Cause I feel so high school every time I look at you
769	53910	20	But look at you
769	53911	21	
769	53912	22	[Interlude]
769	53913	23	Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
769	53914	24	
769	53915	25	[Verse 1]
769	53916	26	Are you gonna marry, kiss, or kill me? (Kill me)
769	53917	27	It's just a game, but really (Really)
769	53918	28	I'm bettin' on all three (All three) for us two
769	53919	29	Get my car door, isn't that sweet? (That sweet)
769	53920	30	Then pull me to thе back seat (The back seat)
769	53921	31	No onе's ever had me (Had me), not like you
769	53922	32	[Bridge]
769	53923	33	Truth, dare, spin bottles
769	53924	34	You know how to ball, I know Aristotle
769	53925	35	Brand new, full throttle
769	53926	36	Touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto
769	53927	37	It's true, swear, scout's honor
769	53928	38	You knew what you wanted and, boy, you got her
769	53929	39	Brand new, full throttle
769	53930	40	You already know, babe
769	53931	41	
769	53932	42	[Verse 2]
769	53933	43	I feel like laughin' in the middle of practice
769	53934	44	Do that impression you did of your dad again
769	53935	45	I'm hearing voices like a madman
769	53936	46	
769	53937	47	[Chorus]
769	53938	48	And in a blink of a crinklin' eye
769	53939	49	I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined
769	53940	50	Cheeks pink in the twinklin' lights
769	53941	51	Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me
769	53942	52	I'll drink what you think, and I'm high
769	53943	53	From smokin' your jokes all damn night
769	53944	54	The brink of a wrinkle in time
769	53945	55	Bittersweet sixteen suddenly
769	53946	56	
769	53947	57	[Post-Chorus]
769	53948	58	I'm watchin' American Pie with you on a Saturday night
769	53949	59	Your friends are around, so be quiet
769	53950	60	I'm tryin' to stifle my sighs
769	53951	61	'Cause I feel so high school (Feel so high school) every time I look at you
769	53952	62	But look at you
769	53953	63	[Outro]
769	53954	64	Truth, dare, spin bottles
769	53955	65	You know how to ball, I know Aristotle
769	53956	66	Brand new, full throttle
769	53957	67	Touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto
769	53958	68	It's true, swear, scout's honor (Yeah)
769	53959	69	You knew what you wanted and, boy, you got her
769	53960	70	Brand-new, full throttle (Yeah)
769	53961	71	You already know, babe
769	53962	72	You already know, babe
770	53471	1	[Verse 1]
770	53472	2	Quick, quick, tell me something awful
770	53473	3	Like you are a poet trapped inside the body of a finance guy
770	53474	4	Tell me all your secrets, all you'll ever be is
770	53475	5	My eternal consolation prize
770	53476	6	You see, I was a debutante in another life, but
770	53477	7	Now I seem to be scared to go outside
770	53478	8	If comfort is a construct, I don't believe in good luck
770	53479	9	Now that I know what's what
770	53480	10	
770	53481	11	[Chorus]
770	53482	12	I hate it here so I will go to secret gardens in my mind
770	53483	13	People need a key to get to, the only one is mine
770	53484	14	I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child
770	53485	15	No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
770	53486	16	I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
770	53487	17	I hate it here
770	53488	18	
770	53489	19	[Verse 2]
770	53490	20	My friends used to play a game where
770	53491	21	We would pick a decade
770	53492	22	We wished we could live in instead of this
770	53493	23	I'd say the 1830s but without all the racists
770	53494	24	And getting married off for the highest bid
770	53495	25	Everyone would look down 'cause it wasn't fun now
770	53496	26	Seems like it was never even fun back then
770	53497	27	Nostalgia is a mind's trick
770	53498	28	If I'd been there, I'd hate it
770	53499	29	It was freezing in the palace
770	53500	30	[Chorus]
770	53501	31	I hate it here so I will go to lunar valleys in my mind
770	53502	32	When they found a better planet, only the gentle survived
770	53503	33	I dreamed about it in the dark, the night I felt like I might die
770	53504	34	No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
770	53505	35	I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
770	53506	36	I hate it here
770	53507	37	
770	53508	38	[Bridge]
770	53509	39	I'm lonely, but I'm good
770	53510	40	I'm bitter, but I swear I'm fine
770	53511	41	I'll save all my romanticism for my inner life and I'll get lost on purpose
770	53512	42	This place made me feel worthless
770	53513	43	Lucid dreams like electricity, the current flies through me
770	53514	44	And in my fantasies, I rise above it
770	53515	45	And way up there, I actually love it
770	53516	46	
770	53517	47	[Chorus]
770	53518	48	I hate it here so I will go to secret gardens in my mind
770	53519	49	People need a key to get to, the only one is mine
770	53520	50	I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child
770	53521	51	No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
770	53522	52	I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
770	53523	53	I hate it here
770	53524	54	
770	53525	55	[Outro]
770	53526	56	Quick, quick, tell me something awful
770	53527	57	Like you are a poet trapped inside the body of a finance guy
771	54028	1	[Verse 1]
771	54029	2	When I picture my hometown
771	54030	3	There's a bronze, spray-tanned statue of you
771	54031	4	And a plaque underneath it
771	54032	5	That threatens to push me down the stairs at our school
771	54033	6	
771	54034	7	[Pre-Chorus]
771	54035	8	And it was always the same searing pain
771	54036	9	But I dreamed that one day I could say
771	54037	10	
771	54038	11	[Chorus]
771	54039	12	All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
771	54040	13	And I can't forgive the way you made me feel
771	54041	14	Screamed, "Fuck you, Aimee" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
771	54042	15	But I can't forget the way you made me heal
771	54043	16	
771	54044	17	[Verse 2]
771	54045	18	And it wasn't a fair fight
771	54046	19	Or a clean kill each time that Aimee stompеd across my grave
771	54047	20	And then she wrotе headlines
771	54048	21	In the local paper, laughing at each baby step I'd take
771	54049	22	
771	54050	23	[Pre-Chorus]
771	54051	24	And it was always the same searing pain
771	54052	25	But I prayed that one day I could say
771	54053	26	[Chorus]
771	54054	27	All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
771	54055	28	And I couldn't wait to show you it was real
771	54056	29	Screamed, "Fuck you, Aimee" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
771	54057	30	But I can't forget the way you made me heal
771	54058	31	Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
771	54059	32	But she used to say she wished that you were dead
771	54060	33	I pushed each boulder up the hill
771	54061	34	Your words are still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head
771	54062	35	
771	54063	36	[Bridge]
771	54064	37	I wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool
771	54065	38	I built a legacy that you can't undo
771	54066	39	But when I count the scars, there's a moment of truth
771	54067	40	That there wouldn't be this if there hadn't been you
771	54068	41	
771	54069	42	[Verse 3]
771	54070	43	And maybe you've reframed it
771	54071	44	And in your mind, you never beat my spirit black and blue
771	54072	45	I don't think you've changed much
771	54073	46	And so I changed your name and any real defining clues
771	54074	47	And one day, your kid comes home singin'
771	54075	48	A song that only us two is gonna know is about you, 'cause
771	54076	49	
771	54077	50	[Chorus]
771	54078	51	All that time you were throwin' punches, it was all for nothin'
771	54079	52	And our town, it looks so small from way up here
771	54080	53	Screamed, "Thank you, Aimee" to the night sky and the stars are stunnin'
771	54081	54	'Cause I can't forget the way you made me heal
771	54082	55	Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
771	54083	56	But she used to say she wished that you were dead
771	54084	57	So I pushed each boulder up that hill
771	54085	58	Your words were still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head
771	54086	59	[Outro]
771	54087	60	Thank you, Aimee
771	54088	61	Thank you, Aimee
772	53528	1	[Verse 1]
772	53529	2	I had died the tiniest death
772	53530	3	I spied the catch in your breath
772	53531	4	Out, out, out, out, out, out
772	53532	5	Northbound I got carried away
772	53533	6	As you boarded your train
772	53534	7	South, south, south, south, south, south
772	53535	8	
772	53536	9	[Pre-Chorus]
772	53537	10	A feather taken by the wind blowing
772	53538	11	I'm afflicted by the not knowing, so
772	53539	12	
772	53540	13	[Chorus]
772	53541	14	I look in people's windows
772	53542	15	Transfixed by rose golden glows
772	53543	16	They have their friends over to drink nice wine
772	53544	17	I look in people's windows
772	53545	18	In case you're at their table
772	53546	19	What if your eyes looked up and met mine
772	53547	20	One more time?
772	53548	21	
772	53549	22	[Verse 2]
772	53550	23	You had stopped and tiltеd your head
772	53551	24	I still ponder what it meant
772	53552	25	Now, now, now, now, now, now
772	53553	26	I triеd searching faces on streets
772	53554	27	What are the chances you'd be
772	53555	28	Downtown, downtown, downtown
772	53556	29	[Pre-Chorus]
772	53557	30	Does it feel alright to not know me?
772	53558	31	I'm addicted to the "if only"
772	53559	32	
772	53560	33	[Chorus]
772	53561	34	So I look in people's windows
772	53562	35	Like I'm some deranged weirdo
772	53563	36	I attend Christmas parties from outside
772	53564	37	I look in people's windows
772	53565	38	In case you're at their table
772	53566	39	What if your eyes looked up and met mine
772	53567	40	One more time?
773	54393	1	[Intro]
773	54394	2	One, two, three, four
773	54395	3	
773	54396	4	[Verse 1]
773	54397	5	Hand on the throttle
773	54398	6	Thought I caught lightning in a bottle
773	54399	7	Oh, but it's gone again
773	54400	8	And it was written
773	54401	9	I got cursed like Eve got bitten
773	54402	10	Oh, was it punishment?
773	54403	11	Pad around when I get home
773	54404	12	I guess a lesser woman would've lost hope
773	54405	13	A greater woman wouldn't beg
773	54406	14	But I looked to the sky and said
773	54407	15	
773	54408	16	[Chorus]
773	54409	17	"Please
773	54410	18	I've been on my knees
773	54411	19	Change the prophecy
773	54412	20	Don't want money
773	54413	21	Just someone who wants my company
773	54414	22	Let it once be me
773	54415	23	Who do I have to speak to
773	54416	24	About if they can redo the prophеcy?"
773	54417	25	
773	54418	26	[Verse 2]
773	54419	27	Cards on the table
773	54420	28	Mine play out likе fools in a fable
773	54421	29	Oh, it was sinking in (Sinking in, oh)
773	54422	30	Slow is the quicksand
773	54423	31	Poison blood from the wound of the pricked hand
773	54424	32	Oh, still I dream of him
773	54425	33	[Chorus]
773	54426	34	Please
773	54427	35	I've been on my knees
773	54428	36	Change the prophecy
773	54429	37	Don't want money
773	54430	38	Just someone who wants my company
773	54431	39	Let it once be me
773	54432	40	Who do I have to speak to
773	54433	41	About if they can redo the prophecy?
773	54434	42	
773	54435	43	[Bridge]
773	54436	44	And I sound like an infant
773	54437	45	Feeling like the very last drops of an ink pen
773	54438	46	A greater woman stays cool
773	54439	47	But I howl like a wolf at the moon
773	54440	48	And I look unstable
773	54441	49	Gathered with a coven 'round a sorceress' table
773	54442	50	A greater woman has faith
773	54443	51	But even statues crumble if they're made to wait
773	54444	52	I'm so afraid I sealed my fate
773	54445	53	No sign of soulmates
773	54446	54	I'm just a paperweight in shades of greige
773	54447	55	Spending my last coin so someone will tell me it'll be okay
773	54448	56	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
773	54449	57	
773	54450	58	[Chorus]
773	54451	59	Please
773	54452	60	I've been on my knees
773	54453	61	Change the prophecy
773	54454	62	Don't want money
773	54455	63	Just someone who wants my company
773	54456	64	Let it once be me
773	54457	65	Who do I have to speak to
773	54458	66	About if they can redo the prophecy?
773	54459	67	Who do I have to speak to
773	54460	68	To change the prophecy?
773	54461	69	[Outro]
773	54462	70	Hand on the throttle
773	54463	71	Thought I caught lightning in a bottle
773	54464	72	Oh, but it's gone again
773	54465	73	Pad around when I get home
773	54466	74	I guess a lesser woman would've lost hope
773	54467	75	A greater woman wouldn't beg
773	54468	76	But I looked to the sky and said ("Please")
774	52817	1	[Verse 1]
774	52818	2	I was in my new house placing daydreams
774	52819	3	Patching up the crack along the wall
774	52820	4	I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying
774	52821	5	'Cause that's where I was when I got the call
774	52822	6	
774	52823	7	[Pre-Chorus]
774	52824	8	When the first stone's thrown, there's screamin'
774	52825	9	In the streets, there's a raging riot
774	52826	10	When it's "Burn the bitch," they're shrieking
774	52827	11	When the truth comes out, it's quiet
774	52828	12	
774	52829	13	[Chorus]
774	52830	14	So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
774	52831	15	And tried to tell the town
774	52832	16	So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say
774	52833	17	Do you believe me now?
774	52834	18	
774	52835	19	[Verse 2]
774	52836	20	I was in my tower weaving nightmares
774	52837	21	Twisting all my smiles into snarls
774	52838	22	They say, "What doesn't kill you makes you aware"
774	52839	23	What happens if it becomes who you are?
774	52840	24	
774	52841	25	[Chorus]
774	52842	26	So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
774	52843	27	And tried to tell the town
774	52844	28	So they set my life in flames, I regret to say
774	52845	29	Do you believe me now?
774	52846	30	[Bridge]
774	52847	31	They knew, they knew, they knew the whole time
774	52848	32	That I was onto somethin'
774	52849	33	The family, the pure greed, the Christian chorus line
774	52850	34	They all said nothin'
774	52851	35	Blood's thick, but nothin' like a payroll
774	52852	36	Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul
774	52853	37	You can mark my words that I said it first
774	52854	38	In a mourning warning, no one heard
774	52855	39	
774	52856	40	[Verse 3]
774	52857	41	I patched up the crack along the wall
774	52858	42	I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying
774	52859	43	'Cause that's where I was when I lost it all
774	52860	44	
774	52861	45	[Chorus]
774	52862	46	So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
774	52863	47	And tried to tell the town
774	52864	48	So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say
774	52865	49	Do you believe me now?
774	52866	50	
774	52867	51	[Post-Chorus]
774	52868	52	Ah, ah, ah
774	52869	53	I was onto somethin'
774	52870	54	Ah, ah
774	52871	55	They all said nothin'
774	52872	56	Blood's thick but nothin' like a payroll
774	52873	57	Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul
774	52874	58	You can mark my words that I said it first
774	52875	59	In a mourning warning, no one heard
774	52876	60	No one heard, not a single word was heard
774	52877	61	[Outro]
774	52878	62	When the first stone's thrown, there's screamin'
774	52879	63	In the streets, there's a raging riot
774	52880	64	When it's "Burn the bitch," they're shrieking
774	52881	65	When the truth comes out, it's quiet
774	52882	66	It's so quiet
775	53756	1	[Verse 1]
775	53757	2	Forgive me, Peter
775	53758	3	My lost fearless leader
775	53759	4	In closets like cedar
775	53760	5	Preserved from when we were just kids
775	53761	6	Is it somethin' I did?
775	53762	7	The goddess of timing
775	53763	8	Once found us beguiling
775	53764	9	She said she was trying
775	53765	10	Peter, was she lying?
775	53766	11	My ribs get the feeling she did
775	53767	12	
775	53768	13	[Pre-Chorus]
775	53769	14	And I didn't wanna come down
775	53770	15	I thought it was just goodbye for now
775	53771	16	
775	53772	17	[Chorus]
775	53773	18	You said you were gonna grow up
775	53774	19	Then you were gonna come find me
775	53775	20	Said you were gonna grow up
775	53776	21	Thеn you were gonna come find mе
775	53777	22	Said you were gonna grow up
775	53778	23	Then you were gonna come find me
775	53779	24	Words from the mouths of babes
775	53780	25	Promises oceans-deep
775	53781	26	But never to keep
775	53782	27	Oh, never to keep
775	53783	28	[Verse 2]
775	53784	29	Are you still a mind reader?
775	53785	30	A natural scene-stealer?
775	53786	31	I've heard great things, Peter
775	53787	32	But life was always easier on you
775	53788	33	Than it was on me
775	53789	34	And sometimes it gets me
775	53790	35	When crossing your jet stream
775	53791	36	We both did the best we could do
775	53792	37	Underneath the same moon
775	53793	38	In different galaxies
775	53794	39	
775	53795	40	[Pre-Chorus]
775	53796	41	And I didn't wanna hang around
775	53797	42	We said it was just goodbye for now
775	53798	43	
775	53799	44	[Chorus]
775	53800	45	You said you were gonna grow up
775	53801	46	Then you were gonna come find me
775	53802	47	Said you were gonna grow up
775	53803	48	Then you were gonna come find me
775	53804	49	Said you were gonna grow up
775	53805	50	Then you were gonna come find me
775	53806	51	Words from the mouths of babes
775	53807	52	Promises oceans-deep
775	53808	53	But never to keep
775	53809	54	Never to keep
775	53810	55	[Bridge]
775	53811	56	And I won't confess that I waited, but I let the lamp burn
775	53812	57	As the men masqueraded, I hoped you'd return
775	53813	58	With your feet on the ground, tell me all that you'd learned
775	53814	59	'Cause love's never lost when perspective is earned
775	53815	60	And you said you'd come and get me, but you were twenty-five
775	53816	61	And the shelf life of those fantasies has expired
775	53817	62	Lost to the "Lost Boys" chapter of your life
775	53818	63	Forgive me, Peter, please know that I tried
775	53819	64	To hold on (Hold on) to the days (To the days)
775	53820	65	When you were mine
775	53821	66	But the woman who sits by the window
775	53822	67	Has turned out the light
775	53823	68	
775	53824	69	[Chorus]
775	53825	70	You said you were gonna grow up
775	53826	71	Then you were gonna come find me
775	53827	72	Said you were gonna grow up
775	53828	73	You said you were gonna grow up
775	53829	74	Then you were gonna come find me
775	53830	75	Said you were gonna grow up
775	53831	76	You said you were gonna grow up
775	53832	77	Then you were gonna come find me
775	53833	78	Said you were gonna grow up
775	53834	79	Then you were gonna come find me
775	53835	80	Said you were gonna grow up
775	53836	81	Then you were gonna come find me
775	53837	82	Words from the mouths of babes
775	53838	83	Promises oceans-deep
775	53839	84	But never to keep
776	54268	1	[Verse 1]
776	54269	2	By all accounts, she almost drowned
776	54270	3	When she was six in frigid water
776	54271	4	And I can confirm she made
776	54272	5	A curious child, ever reviled
776	54273	6	By everyone except her own father
776	54274	7	With a quite bewitching face
776	54275	8	Splendidly selfish, charmingly helpless
776	54276	9	Excellent fun 'til you get to know her
776	54277	10	Then she runs like it's a race
776	54278	11	Behind her back, her best mates laughed
776	54279	12	And they nicknamed her "The Bolter"
776	54280	13	
776	54281	14	[Chorus]
776	54282	15	Started with a kiss
776	54283	16	"Oh, we must stop meeting like this"
776	54284	17	But it always ends up with a town car speeding
776	54285	18	Out the drive one evening
776	54286	19	Ended with the slam of a door
776	54287	20	Then he'll call her a whore
776	54288	21	Wish he wouldn't be sore
776	54289	22	But as she was leaving
776	54290	23	It felt like breathing
776	54291	24	
776	54292	25	[Post-Chorus]
776	54293	26	All her fuckin' lives
776	54294	27	Flashed before her eyes
776	54295	28	It feels like the time
776	54296	29	She fell through the ice
776	54297	30	Then came out alive
776	54298	31	[Verse 2]
776	54299	32	He was a cad, wanted her bad
776	54300	33	Just like any good trophy hunter
776	54301	34	And she liked the way it tastes
776	54302	35	Taming a bear, making him care
776	54303	36	Watching him jump then pulling him under
776	54304	37	And at first blush, this is fate
776	54305	38	When it's all roses, portrait poses
776	54306	39	Central Park Lake in tiny rowboats
776	54307	40	What a charming Saturday
776	54308	41	That's when she sees the littlest leaks
776	54309	42	Down in the floorboards
776	54310	43	And she just knows she must bolt
776	54311	44	
776	54312	45	[Chorus]
776	54313	46	Started with a kiss
776	54314	47	"Oh, we must stop meeting like this"
776	54315	48	But it always ends up with a town car speeding
776	54316	49	Out the drive one evening
776	54317	50	Ended with the slam of a door
776	54318	51	Then he'll call her a whore
776	54319	52	Wish he wouldn't be sore
776	54320	53	But as she was leaving
776	54321	54	It felt like breathing
776	54322	55	
776	54323	56	[Post-Chorus]
776	54324	57	All her fuckin' lives
776	54325	58	Flashed before her eyes (Ah-ah-ah)
776	54326	59	It feels like the time
776	54327	60	She fell through the ice
776	54328	61	Then came out alive
776	54329	62	[Bridge]
776	54330	63	She's been many places with
776	54331	64	Men of many faces
776	54332	65	First, they're off to the races
776	54333	66	And she's laughing, drawin' aces
776	54334	67	But none of it is changin'
776	54335	68	That the chariot is waitin'
776	54336	69	Hearts are hers for the breakin'
776	54337	70	There's escape in escaping
776	54338	71	
776	54339	72	[Chorus]
776	54340	73	Started with a kiss
776	54341	74	"Oh, we must stop meeting like this"
776	54342	75	But it always ends up with a town car speeding
776	54343	76	Out the drive one evenin'
776	54344	77	Ended with the slam of a door
776	54345	78	But she's got the best stories
776	54346	79	You can be sure
776	54347	80	That as she was leaving
776	54348	81	It felt like freedom
776	54349	82	
776	54350	83	[Post-Chorus]
776	54351	84	All her fuckin' lives
776	54352	85	Flashed before her eyes (And she realized)
776	54353	86	It feels like the time
776	54354	87	She fell through the ice
776	54355	88	Then came out alive
777	53840	1	[Verse 1]
777	53841	2	Long may you reign
777	53842	3	You're an animal, you are bloodthirsty
777	53843	4	Out window panes talking utter nonsense
777	53844	5	You have no idea
777	53845	6	
777	53846	7	[Pre-Chorus]
777	53847	8	Strings tied to levers
777	53848	9	Slowed-down clocks tethered
777	53849	10	All this showmanship
777	53850	11	To keep it for you in sweetness
777	53851	12	
777	53852	13	[Chorus]
777	53853	14	Way to go, tiger
777	53854	15	Higher and higher
777	53855	16	Wilder and lighter
777	53856	17	For you
777	53857	18	
777	53858	19	[Verse 2]
777	53859	20	Long may you roar
777	53860	21	At your dinosaurs
777	53861	22	You're a just ruler
777	53862	23	Covered in mud, you look ridiculous
777	53863	24	And you have no idea
777	53864	25	
777	53865	26	[Pre-Chorus]
777	53866	27	Buried down deep
777	53867	28	And out of your reach
777	53868	29	The secret we all vowed
777	53869	30	To keep it from you in sweetness
777	53870	31	[Chorus]
777	53871	32	Way to go, tiger
777	53872	33	Higher and higher
777	53873	34	Wilder and lighter
777	53874	35	For you
777	53875	36	
777	53876	37	[Bridge]
777	53877	38	You got the dragonflies above your bed
777	53878	39	You have a favorite spot on the swing set
777	53879	40	You have no room in your dreams for regrets
777	53880	41	(You have no idea)
777	53881	42	The time will arrive for the cruel and the mean
777	53882	43	You'll learn to bounce back just like your trampoline
777	53883	44	But now we'll curtail your curiosity
777	53884	45	In sweetness
777	53885	46	
777	53886	47	[Chorus]
777	53887	48	Way to go, tiger (Way to go, tiger)
777	53888	49	Higher and higher (Higher and higher)
777	53889	50	Wilder and lighter
777	53890	51	For you
778	54356	1	[Verse 1]
778	54357	2	Now and then, she rereads the manuscript
778	54358	3	Of the entire torrid affair
778	54359	4	They compared their licenses
778	54360	5	He said, "I'm not a donor but
778	54361	6	I'd give you my heart if you needed it"
778	54362	7	She rolled her eyes and said
778	54363	8	"You're a professional"
778	54364	9	He said, "No, just a good samaritan"
778	54365	10	He said that if the sex was half as good as the conversation was
778	54366	11	Soon, they'd be pushin' strollers
778	54367	12	But, soon, it was over
778	54368	13	
778	54369	14	[Verse 2]
778	54370	15	In the age of him, she wished she was thirty
778	54371	16	And made coffee every morning in a Frеnch press
778	54372	17	Afterwards, she only atе kids' cereal
778	54373	18	And couldn't sleep unless it was in her mother's bed
778	54374	19	Then she dated boys who were her own age
778	54375	20	With dart boards on the backs of their doors
778	54376	21	She thought about how he said since she was so wise beyond her years
778	54377	22	Everything had been above board
778	54378	23	She wasn't sure
778	54379	24	
778	54380	25	[Bridge]
778	54381	26	And the years passed like scenes of a show
778	54382	27	The professor said to write what you know
778	54383	28	Lookin' backwards might be the only way to move forward
778	54384	29	Then the actors were hitting their marks
778	54385	30	And the slow dance was alight with the sparks
778	54386	31	And the tears fell in synchronicity with the score
778	54387	32	And at last, she knew what the agony had been for
778	54388	33	[Outro]
778	54389	34	The only thing that's left is the manuscript
778	54390	35	One last souvenir from my trip to your shores
778	54391	36	Now and then, I reread the manuscript
778	54392	37	But the story isn't mine anymore
